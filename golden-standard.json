    "body": "But does anything function alone with no other built in factors? For example, in high school debate there are two key factors that are used- How you say it (speech) and what you are saying (facts, arguments). But the majority of it for debate is how you say it so I'll take it instead that the majority of success will have to be because of luck or who you know instead of being able to do something or talent. \n\nLucky is defined by having good luck, luck being the force that seems to operate for good or ill in a person's life, as in shaping circumstances, events, or opportunities. I'll give 2 examples: one with a lot of luck but no talent and another one with a lot of talent but no luck. 1. Jim lands a job interview that he recently found in the paper the second he opens it. He goes to the job interview with all of his charm and best clothes. He finds that this attractive redhead is doing the interviews, seemingly her first time to be doing this so she is relatively laid back. Jim goes in her interview and does perfectly! He already knows all of the questions and talks in a smooth voice.  Now there is a portion to show coding.  After about 5 minutes she realizes that he doesn't know anything and tells him sorry. Now Bob walks in to another room that has a grumpy old man sitting there.  He asks the most difficult questions possible! Luckily as Bob is an experienced person with interviews and a talented coder, he answered the questions to the best of his ability and later blew the interviewers mind with his coding abilities. \n\nBob gets the job because of his experienced talent of interviews and amazing coding abilities that gets him through. Jim does not although he did perfectly with the easy questions but proved terribly in coding on the computer.",

There are lots of people that come across good opportunities, but many of them are either unprepared for them or do not pounce on them when they appear so the luck is squandered.\n\nThe extremely successful position themselves to take advantage of every lucky break that comes along.\n\nSo this isn't exactly a refutation of exactly what you said. But perhaps it might change how you view luck in a more general way. A lot of times the more successful didn't have more luck than others, but they were able to better take advantage of the luck they had.",

She came in to his life at a time when he was experimenting heavily with LSD, a drug which he has stated killed his ego completely. He was extremely dissatisfied with his involvement with the Beatles and the fame that it had brought him. When he first met Yoko, she didn't give a shit who he was. Can you imagine the allure of a woman who couldn't care less about your fame after years of being chased by screaming girls every time you set foot in public?\n\nI think you'll find also that they were extremely aligned in their philosophical and political beliefs, which was the bedrock of their relationship really. Also, from 1975-1980 he virtually withdrew completely from the public eye to be with his family. People with trophy wives (which is essentially what you are equating Yoko to) simply don't do that.",

I think John does look fairly unusual for an Englishman as he does have a quite flat nose and narrow eyes. \n\nWhile it looks like some of the pictures in your links may be from his retirement period (most notably the one where he is naked and cradling up to Yoko), a majority of them are between 1968 and I'd say around '74 as that is when the pair of them were most active, both in music and activism. Mind you, John did re-enter the music business shortly before his death in 1980 so there are a few shots in there that can throw you off. You can usually tell though because they have both aged significantly, as can be seen in [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/P6ltXc8.jpg).\n\nCheers for my first delta, glad I could help shed some light on it.",

Perhaps I can get you to share in my ambivalence.\n\nFirst some background stuff: There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding tort law (the law of civil liability) and I want to clear up some of the more common ones. (This would be a fruitless endeavor if we weren't starting on the same page.) Am I safe in assuming that:\n\n1. You are not a lawyer, and\n2. Your idea of what liability of law is comes from the waivers we have to sign when we go Scuba diving, parachuting, and mountain climbing?\n\nMany of the provisions under those disclaimers are for CYA purposes only. Chances are, if someone tried to sue for most of the things covered under such a waiver they wouldn't win anyways, the cost of adding in such a provision is so cheap (the cost of a few extra peices of paper and ink) that companies feel its worthwhile to do so, in case they get an irrational jury or something. \n\nThe effect of this is that the boundaries of what might actually create liability are actually far, far narrower than what you might think just from reading the waivers. \n\n\nThat being said: I would challenge the idea that possibility of civil remedy promotes poor decision-making on two ground.\n\n********\n\nFirst -- I would challenge the idea that possibility of civil remedy promotes poor decision-making with the fact that in all jurisdictions I know of, the defendant in a lawsuit for negligence has the defense of **comparative negligence**. \n\nThat is to say, if the defendant can show that the plaintiff was negligent and that contributed to his injury, the defendant may be relieved of some or all of his liability, depending on the degree of the plaintiff's negligence compared to that of the defendant.\n\nMany states have the rule where if the plaintiff was even one iota negligent, the defendant is completely relieved of ANY liability regardless of how negligent he was. This is called **contributory negligence** and it's a little more controversial. (For the reasons you mention, I am ambivalent as to which is the better rule.)\n\nPart two incoming (because apparently people are getting impatient).",

This is not a disorder, but it still can be quite severe and result in self-harm or suicide. Depression as a mood disorder is persistent, and in many cases lifelong, feelings of being \"down\", inadequate, worthless, suicidal, and just generally dissatisfied with life. \nThese may be people who are experiencing transient periods of depression, these may be liars, or they may be people covering up their depression. Speaking for myself as someone who has an anxiety disorder that causes persistent depression, I was known to be quite a boisterous, friendly and upbeat person in college. Many times I was the life of a party and I had a very large group of friends among whom I was known for being excitable and happy. Then I would go to my dorm room and cry or cut myself. Neither of those things was fake either. My friends genuinely made me happy, and why would I want to bring out my depression into a situation in which I was happy? Why would I want to deliberately bring myself and others down? On top of this, I would occasionally experience manic episodes. Mania is the other pole from which bipolar disorder gets its name. Whereas depression is characterized by a lack of energy and feelings of apathy or hopelessness, mania is characterized by an overwhelming intensity of energy that can result in anxiousness and panic, often resulting in that hair-trigger anger that people imagine when they think of BPD, or if you're lucky and spending time with people you like that mania can result in a high-energy euphoria that is actually one of the best feelings I have ever experienced. One of the things that bummed me out the most when I went on medication was knowing that these euphoric episodes would go away.\n\nAnyways, hope that helped some.",

You don't need a controlled substance - lots of over the counter meds will do it. \n\nYou had this friend in high school who tried it previously, that means he was probably 16 at most when it happened.

    "body": "Hi there, I'm happy to hear that you help out those animals that need loving homes and while not ready to get a Sphynx cat, are at least open-minded about it.\n\nSo I'm gonna lay out the benefits and ignore the costs (related to care and such) that I'm sure you are aware of them with your cat experiences.\n\n1) Your *Boo-Bear*\n\nYeah, I'm talking about your boyfriend, I'm not sure what you call each other, so I'm gonna roll with that.  Your Boo-Bear, for whatever reason, thinks that he wants a sphynx cat.  While your statement above is unclear, I am going to assume that he has experience with cats as well.  Now I would recommend that you ask him why he wants this particular type, and what he thinks of the cuddly issue.  But, remember that there is always the added benefit of, as long as you talk about it and do it together, making your Boo-Bear happy.  I'm not saying go along with it just because he wants to, but try to understand why he wants to, and realize that this is a decision you are making together, which really adds to the relationship.\n\n2)  Holy shit that cat is sa-weeeeet!  First off, its distinct!  Your friends will be like \"woah! that's the coolest cat ever! So unique!\"  It stands up proud like its not gonna take shit from nobody!  Also, its basically a God!  The Egyptians worshipped em, its even named for a mythical creature of incredible intelligence.  Hell, the Egyptians were so terrified of those things that during the Battle of Pelusium, the Persian Cambyses II released hundreds of 'em and the Egyptian refused to fight, lest they harm their Cat-God.  Persians killed em where they stood! That cat helped conquer nations, can a tabby say that?\n\n2) Now its disputed but they may be better for people with allergies.  See they don't have fur, and people are allergic to chemicals in cat dander, which is spread all over by the fur, when they're petter or whatever.  But this ain't got none of those little allergy missiles!  So while the allergy problem isn't TOTALLY gone, it is reduced.  Now you can make friends with the lesser-folk!\n\n3)  ANYTHING can be cuddly!  My friend has porcupine he carries everywhere!  His roommate sleeps with his snake wrapped all around him!  He even just got a badass tarantula that sits on his shoulder!  See, you just need to appreciate your pet, and to accept it for what it has to offer!  Look here: http://imgur.com/a/Qsrl3\nSee, \"cuddly\" is a frame of mind!\n\nDisclaimer:  I am by no means an expert on cats or any other living organism for that matter.  Please consult the breeder, veterinarians, etc., for the REAL advice.\n\nI hope this helps!",

I googled it and aparently while not all Spynx have peach fuzz it is not uncommon. If you want a Spynx with a tiny bit of hair I am sure you can find one. And, very soft peach fuzz + nice warm body makes a reallycuddly animal.\n\nNow, I totally get wanting to adopt  cats that need a loving home instead of paying a lot of money for some breed, but maybe you can combine the wish to help with getting your partner's favourite cat breed. I googled \"sphynx cat rescue\" and actually came up with a few links. Also, one of the cats I talked about before? He was the \"rrunt\" of his family, aparetnly the breeder thought he could not sell him and actually gave him for free to his new owner. So it's harder to rescue a purebreed cat, but possible.",

Shortly after the second time, when the dog is just standing there, he shoots it.  You can see that the dog is standing on the sidewalk at least 5 or 6 feet away from the officer when he fires.  I'd understand if he shot it while the dog was in the act of trying to bite him but he clearly wasn't.  The dog was only threatening the officer when the officer threatened him.  But despite the threat not being imminent he shot the dog because he's incompetent.  \n\nAfter he realized it was a bad idea to try and grab the dog's leash, he should have stopped to think for a second and figured something better out.  The best solution would have been to uncuff the owner for a little second to secure the dog.  The owner wasn't violent and not a threat to the police, you can see he immediately complied when they asked to cuff him.  \n\nEven if they aren't going to uncuff a suspect, all cops have at least one form of non-lethal force.  Either a taser or pepper spray.  They also have training into when it's appropriate to use non-lethal vs lethal force.  Either one of these would have worked fantastically at taking down a dog, but the officer came over gun-drawn to deal with it.  Why did he need his gun out?  Why didn't he have his taser out instead?  Was there some situation where he thought he would need a gun going on there?  Clearly he made a major mistake in deciding what type of force to use.",

You are going to be running off of instinct, it's like how a drowning man will try to pull down someone who is trying to save him. Also, I've heard that since there aren't any certifications for martial arts, it's a big issue that there are scams which aren't really teaching anything useful but this was from a cracked article so take it with a grain of salt.\nWell the thing is, Trayvon probably wasn't but that doesn't mean Zimmerman is lying. He was placed in a high stress situation and it isn't unreasonable that he could have thought trayvon was reaching for his gun for whatever reason. In hindsight, this might not have been true but self-defense claims don't require him to have perfect knowledge of the situation.",

In fact GZs friend (Taffy) that is on CNN every night used this same argument. In addition its the similar to what GZ defense is using in that he felt the beating he was taking was life threatening. We know now that his injuries were nowhere close to being life threatening. But what we do know that GZ knew is that police were on their way and people were around, I will admit that is unfair for me to say that as I wasn't the one that got punched, hindsight is 20/20. \n\nFor me it comes down to George Zimmerman is an **adult and trained neighborhood watchman**. GZ knew TM was a kid. At some point he should have identified who he was as he had plenty of opportunity. He should have never left his car, IMO he left his car to catch TM, there was no other reason for him to leave his car in the rain. He needs to be punished for his incompetence. \nPlease don't assume you know what I base my position on, I very mixed emotions on the entire thing and have gone back and forth on my position. And how the media spun it had really no affect on me. One guy is dead and the other guy life is probably ruined. Both could have and should have made better decisions, however one was an adult, the other was a kid. \n\nYou should really refrain from calling TM a thug, racist, street fighter, drug dealer etc..  Ultimately with the facts on your side it those things should not matter one bit, it could have been the Pope and it would have been justified. \nGZ has a history of his own.",

Then, the scuffle took place, but have you seen Zimmerman's face after the \"pummeling\"? No damage to his eyes, cheeks, fine a broken nose, but getting beaten to death? Nope, Zimmerman's lying about that. \n\nAlso, why should we simply believe that Zimmerman didn't START the fight? I love how people just simply assume Zimmerman's version was right, without questioning whether he shoved the teen (a violent act, but not one that would show in the autopsy). \n\nAlso, if he's getting beaten to death, he shoots a perfect shot to the chest, WITH someone on top of him waling on him with deadly punches??\n\nAs for the following, there's a conservative, a respected one who agrees with me.\n\nConservative intellectual George will echoed the same sentiment:\n\n\"Mr. Zimmerman says he was acting under this self-defense law, but he is said to have been recorded saying he pursued the person. You cannot be in pursuit and acting in self-defense.”\nhttp://www.mediaite.com/tv/george-will-on-trayvon-martin-stand-your-ground-law-is-a-bad-idea/\n\nFinally, if I'm armed, and this is just me, but I'm going to make sure that I'm a distance from a potential threat, so that I can draw the weapon. I'm not getting inches away from someone who could hurt me, or prevent me from grabbing the gun. But then again, that's me, obviously Zimmerman \"somehow\" knew, without warning the kid that he was armed, that he'd be able to both confront the potential \"perp\" in close proximity, possibly get into a fight, but also miraculously pull his gun out without a problem.",

    "body": "If we believe Zimmerman's statements, and the police as well as a jury found no apparent reason not to, Zimmerman did not know Martin's race when he began following him. What attracted Zimmerman's attention was a man wearing a hood walking between houses at night, in a neighborhood that had been troubled by burglaries.\n\nLets put this another way. Is there any actual evidence to suggest that Zimmerman is a racist? This seems to be an assertion that's being made between the lines without any real support. \nSadly, yes. I'd say it's conditional: an older, clean-cut black man wearing a suit? No. A young black man wearing certain kinds of fashion, sporting tattoos and gold teeth? Yes. Is that racist? I'd argue no. Is it a form of prejudice? That's arguable - clothing and manner of dress are used for a variety of reasons, but one being to signify a certain set of beliefs and values, an adherence to a certain social \"code\". \n\nThe fact is that inner city/ghetto culture in this country has rightfully earned a reputation for thuggish behavior. It isn't George Zimmerman's fault that if you open a hip-hop club in a city, even in a nice neighborhood, you have to pay for ten times more security and still deal with a higher frequency of fights and gang activity. That's just a fact, and we can either own up to it and figure out how to deal with it, or we can go off into some hippie-dippy la-la land of ignorant political correctness. It isn't a matter of skin color, it's a matter of cultural mores and values promulgated by different quarters of society. But it is an important matter that needs to be addressed: the epidemic of violence in the inner city is claiming a lot of lives, and costing a lot more their livelihoods. If we really care about our children and our countrymen, we will summon up the courage to stop looking for scapegoats and face up to this serious problem. Trayvon Martin, who by all accounts knocked a guy onto the ground and then continued beating him mercilessly, is a sad victim of this culture, as are *so many* young black men and women. Look at the homicide rates in Chicago, look at the faces of the victims. Look at the perpetrators... it's not a bunch of George Zimmermans.\n\nI feel tremendous sympathy for the kid's family. I feel tremendous sympathy for the kid himself... he could be so many kids I grew up with, called friend, ate dinner with. We've all made mistakes, and you and I, dear reader, are still here to talk about it, able to learn from them and carry on with our lives. Sadly, Trayvon isn't still with us, and will never have that opportunity to learn from mistakes. He didn't deserve that fate. \n\nBut the reality is that George Zimmerman is not ultimately to blame for his fate... George Zimmerman had no other choice, if we take a rational reading of events. Anyone who says they would passively lay there and let themselves be pinned to the ground and beaten into unconsciousness or worse on the street is either lying or hopelessly naive, and probably both. What's to blame for Trayvon's fate is a culture that teaches our young men that they are not men unless they solve their problems with violence, that respect is synonymous with beating people up, and using your words and your head instead of your fists is cowardly, and that running away from a meaningless confrontation is a shameful act rather than a wise one. It's a fate that will continue to befall an unfortunate number of us, and disproportionately those of us who are black or poor or from the 'hood, until we steel ourselves to confronting the real problem.",

Both parties were on edge\n\n2. Martin had an opportunity to leave the scene, but did not (this piece may not have been related, but can be meaningful in aggregate)\n\n3. Martin had Zimmerman pinned to the ground with Zimmerman having a head wound at the time of the shooting.\n\nOf course, 3 is the big one unless someone has a *strong* argument that Zimmerman escalated physical assault.  An out-of-shape guy was in a position he probably could not escape from, having received the first of (what could have been many, or could not have been any more) wounds that would have a good chance of permanently injuring or killing him.\n\nThat's such an overwhelming amount of reasonable doubt that only a terrible defence couldn't get one person on a jury.  The police didn't seem to *want* to arrest, the DA didn't seem to *want* to prosecute.  There's a good reason.  They had to know the odds were slim and that they could not prosecute later if new evidence came out.

He would repeat \"reasonable doubt\" until the first reasonable doubt led people to go \"oh, shit...that's reasonable doubt\"\n\nA key part of your belief is that there were assumptions made of him being dangerous.  How could anyone portray anyone else on top of a guy slamming his head into the ground as NOT dangerous?  Further, while he did not have a criminal record, he would be extremely easy to paint as a criminal, from his violent/angry photographs to the *reasons* of his suspension from high school.  \n\nThen, look at stuff like this [picture](http://axiomamnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/martin-zimmerman-case-trayvons-body-crime-scene.png).  The jury did.  The jury also (presumably) heard that Martin bragged about being a repeat violent offender so much that his own mother thought he was arrested when he was 5-hours late from 7/11.\n\nIf you've got testimony that supports \"I beat the shit out of people who look at me wrong\" and suddenly that person is shot while on to of a wounded man with no violent history, and there are no good witnesses... if the story matches the forensics, and there's no compelling evidence, the guy walks.",

    "body": "The third book is absent of danger? What about the Dementors that Harry regularly encounters, nearly dying most of the time? While Sirius Black ends up being an ally, for the first part of the book, there definitely was a very real fear of the idea of Sirius Black. \n\nPoA has a lot of the same elements (such as how developed the world is and the humour, etc.) as the first two books, but is a lot darker in a sense. It builds up an inevitably direct clash between good and evil. You mention that the best books are ones like the Chamber of Secrets, but Voldemort didn't even really come into play until the end; the characters were more worried about the Basilisk (though they didn't know it was, in fact, a Basilisk). In PoA, there is supposed to be someone directly out to get Harry, which doesn't go for the first two. In my opinion, that's more of a danger.\n\nRegarding angst: books like The Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix are way, way more angsty. In fact, off the top of my head, all that I can really think about that qualifies as angst in PoA is when Harry contemplates going after Sirius Black (which isn't even necessarily teenage angst, seeing as it could happen to anyone), and Ron and Hermione's issues with each other. As a matter of fact, I think that one of the better parts of PoA is that develops characters in a much better way than the first two books, while not laying it on too much. The characters grow way more in this book than the first two, and there are way more moral issues and such.\n\nAnd yet, even though there's character development and such, one thing I really like about PoA is that it still retains similar flavour and charm from the first two books. However, it's the only year where disasters and other things don't ruin the year for the students, even though dark events are still unfolding. Things like the Boggart lesson and the Quidditch final are enjoyable because nothing like that really happens in other books. In the first book, everything was new and shiny; in the second, there were people being attacked; in the fourth book, there was the Triwizard Tournament; in the fifth, there was Umbridge; in the sixth, the anti-Voldemort movement was started, and the the last book was barely at Hogwarts. PoA mixes the danger of the second with the world-building of the first in a good way. \n\nIt's also a really good transition and set-up for the Voldemort-filled part of the series, and the ending isn't a perfect Hollywood ending like the first two. There are doubts and the real servant of Voldemort is on the loose at the end. It's less sweet. It's nice to have Harry save the day, win a million points for Gryffindor with his antics, and have his friends all cheer for him, but it's far more interesting to have an ending that leaves you with questions and doubts for the next book. Voldemort doesn't hurt Harry at the end, but his servant is off to resurrect him. \n\nAlso, I don't know why you're merely dismissing the backstory and time travel aspects. The backstory was really interesting. The time travel was plain cool. It was icing on the cake, but at least it can help in avoiding last place. \n\nFinally, the third book is, in my opinion, one of the best to re-read. For more intense books like the last one, a lot of the intensity/drama/action/suspense is lost when you re-read it. The PoA is a good mix of mystery and other stuff, so it's better for re-reading. \n\n**TL;DR, PoA has more danger, better character development and world-building, a better ending and re-read value, and lots of other cool factors, including time travel.**",

One example I just remembered is the Ministry being a much more real presence, which brought a maturity to a world that was mostly run by a just-kids mentality for two books. However, even though the distractions from Voldemort were much-needed and never boring, it feels like PoA was artificially set up as such. The later books (i.e. the much longer ones) had what I feel is a better balance of non-Voldy plot development and main storyline events. But in PoA, it feels like Rowling decided to dedicate an entire book to just fleshing out the world. It was obviously successful, but I think it stands out as something like a very interesting intermission for the series instead of a legitimate entry in the saga of Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived.",

I've also heard a second hand account of a conversation a friend of mine had with the marksman instructor who trained Oswald in the military. He testifies Oswald was a good enough shot.\n\n- We'll likely never know if Oswald was hired, but I believe he was hired by a friend of Communism, either a government (Russia, Cuba) or group (Communist Party members), most likely Russia. Kennedy was a threat because I believe Russia feared him escalating the Cold War into an actual war, and despite their hard attitude, they didn't want a nuclear war either.\n\n- I believe the Mafia thought they would be blamed, as they weren't too fond of Kennedy, and so they were happy to help out when asked to kill Oswald in revenge. They never knew, but the same people who hired LHO hired them. They chose Ruby because, he loved America, and he was terminal. He didn't have long anyway, so he was a low risk to talk. Once Ruby dies in prison, all loose ends are tied.\n\n- No one within the American government was involved. It was not an inside job.\n\nAgain, I draw these conclusions based on what I've read.

Re-examining the distance Oswald was shooting from and the fact that he did actually miss twice, it fits that someone with his marksmanship skills would’ve done poorly but still hit his target.\n\n* I’m still skeptical about why a communist group would want to kill JFK. You’re right to point out that post-assassination most of the American public was more concerned with the effect the attack had on domestic affairs and the personal lives of the First Lady, etc. Yet that ignores the fact that LBJ immediately succeeding Kennedy led to increases in tensions with the USSR both in the short term and more over in the long term. I still don’t see why communist groups would want to kill Kennedy in Dallas; why didn’t they kill him around the Bay of Pigs or the Cuban Missile Crisis? I also feel like you brush off them trusting Oswald; if he was actually hired and then apprehended, he would have still had plenty of time to tell one of the Dallas police officers or FBI agents who interrogated him for several hours at least some degree of information about who had hired him. Sure, the FBI might have thought he was a nut, but in the immediate aftermath of a presidential assassination, I seriously doubt that they wouldn’t have followed up on every piece of information he provided, regardless of how crazy it sounded (and communists hiring an assassin in the political climate of the early 60’s isn’t that crazy). Sure, Oswald *didn’t* rat on the people who hired him (aside from saying he was a “patsy”) but the odds that he *might* have still seem to me to preclude a communist group from hiring such a lose cannon (who, again, defected *away* from the USSR despite initially professing his love for the Soviets).\n\n* If you can convince me on the Russia/Communist angle, I’m starting to buy the next link in the chain, of Mafia involvement. That said, I don’t see the evidence in your argument for Mafia involvement. Sure, they *could* have, and I see their motivations, but what is your actual proof for Mafia involvement?",

There was some ambiguity in his character that keeps you intrigued. There is obviously something to his relationship with H.W. that goes beyond simple exploitation. Saving him from the oil well and the way he cradle him afterwards shows that there is some sort feelings there. Also how he greets H.W. on his return from the school again shows that something has developed between them. Also his interactions with Henry show that he wanted some sort of human relationship otherwise he would of just sent him away after their first meeting.\n\nI didn't have any problem with the structure of the movie or the leaps in time. This is the first I've heard of anybody having issue with that as well. I don't know what else to say about that.\n\nI don't think broader context was really necessary for the film and in fact think that the intense focus on Plainview was one of its strengths. I think broadening the focus would have meant that the film would have lost its tension.\n\nI don't see Plainview killing Eli as puzzling. In fact I think it is really the only ending that would have made sense. What happens to somebody that is driven by success to sociopathic ends after they win that success? They turn on themselves and anybody around them. This is why it also showed Plainview pushing H.W. out of his life for good.",

He could just as easily been sizing his \"brother\" up to see if he would be a threat.\nLonely I'll buy but he comes off more as a sociopath who puts his own needs and wants ahead of everything and everyone else. He does provide for people but it seems like more of a business transaction, buying goodwill so he can continue drilling, rather than genuine altruism. He's willing to try and cheat Eli's family out of their property, he uses HW, I'm pretty sure that qualifies as malicious.",

In Aliens, there were a ton of aliens, making the adversary even more terrifying. However, in the third movie, they are back to one alien. So, how do they up the terror factor in a world with one alien? See next point.\n\n- No weapons. The only way to create tension with only one alien is to have a world with no weapons. Are you kidding me? Now, Alien and Aliens are still great horror/sci-fi movies without the action, but the whole \"don't shoot them, they bleed acid\" and \"you need a flamethrower\" themes have completely been thrown out. They are completely defenseless, and the lack of any firearm action really takes away from the movie.\n\n- The fact that the alien they are fighting used a dog as a host. Thus, it takes on traits of the dog, looks like a dog, etc. Apparently, this is why the aliens in the first two movies look like they do; they used humans as hosts. Apparently, this is a mythology point with the alien franchise. BUT IT IS NEVER EXPLAINED. The alien also looks very different from what we expect, but they never explain why.\n\n- The fucking 1st person camera angles. Oh my God.

    "body": "Dexter season eight is awful.  It is so bad, that if there were a real life Dexter his first priority would be murdering everyone responsible for the travesty of season eight.  And I weep daily that there is not a real life Dexter.\n\nI am going to mention some events from the season.  I'm not calling these \"spoilers\" because that would imply that there was something to spoil.  Instead, I'm calling these \"saviors\" because I hope it ruins the plot and saves someone else from wasting their time with this idiotic show.\n\nLets start with what a good show is.  Dexter is a \"Dark Drama\" - and what I expect from this kind of show is, in a metaphor, a killer whale.  The whale is sleek and smooth in the same way that the show should be viscerally.  The whale is dangerous and the show should take risks and push boundaries.  The whale is subtle, a four and a half ton animal swimming at thirty miles an hour under the calm surface of the water - until the whale decides to let you see his dorsal.\n\nThe archetypal scene of season eight, was the one with Hanna McKay and that private detective on the bus.  Hanna injects the detective and tells him \"I've just given you a sedative, you'll wake up in a couple hours\".  Why did she say this?  I'll go through a few possible reasons.\n\n1. The character would have?  No.  Absolutely not.  Hanna is a subtle poisoner.  Announcing on a crowded bus, and in the company of a child, that you have just poisoned someone is not only reckless and idiotic (we know how this poison works, the guy is already zonked out, she is explaining to no one), but it is also anathema to her character.  She would want to keep things quiet and secret.\n\n2. The viewer needed the exposistion?  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Someone entirely unfamiliar with the series, watching that clip on mute would have been able to tell the relevant details.  She injects the guy, he passes out, she escapes.  Yup.  Plus, the Dexter viewer is intimately familiar with how this poison works.\n\n3. The show wants to make it painfully clear that Hanna (despite being a serial killer) isn't killing the guy now that she is a love interest.  Sadly, this is the correct answer.\n\nAt this point, the show has been neutered.  Any kind of danger or risk taking in terms of plotting elements is gone.  Hanna is the good person now, only doing good things.  She would never kill anyone and the show will use retard gloves to pointless drive that into you.\n\nContrast this with the scene in Breaking Bad were Lydia comments that there is only a single packet of Stevia remaining.  This scene feels like the lurch of an unexplained ripple beneath your life raft in the midst of still waters.  Dexter season eight is like they ranked all the Dexter fanfiction that existed and then decided to film one, but they accidentally chose from the bottom of the list instead of the top.\n\nWhere once the show was clever, it became bumbling and hamfisted.  Dexter can't do anything right.  Constantly failing to kill people he should, making mistakes, never learning from his actions.  Oh, taking this boy murderer under your wing now buddy?  HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES HAS THAT FAILED FOR YOU BY NOW?  Wants to kill Hanna, can't.  Wants to kill so and so.  Can't.  Wants to blah blah blah.\n\nThe narrative is clumsy and jagged.  The motivations of characters reverse for no real reason.  Deb wants to kill Dexter all of a sudden.  Nope, changed her mind, helping him again.  Now she is dead.  Dexter wants to live with Hanna, nope now he wants to kill himself now that Deb is dead.  Nope, he survived driving his boat through a hurricane and is now a logger.  There is a dangerous brain surgeon serial killer.  Nope, he is caught.  Now free again cause Dexter can't kill him.  Now caught, nope free.  Dexter has a new love interest, nope she is dead.  And on and on and on.  How are Masuka and his daughter getting along now?  Oh she uses drugs!\n\nThe show always struggled to be plausible, but in season eight it doesn't even bother trying.  Why is Hanna staying at your sister's house?  Why doesn't she wear a fucking wig when she goes out?  Again, look at the efforts they go to in Breaking Bad to disguise themself.  Now imagine Hanna walking into a hospital with no disguise AND GIVING THE ADDRESS WHERE SHE IS CURRENTLY STAYING! Why are you getting romantically involved with a serial killer whose MO is killing her partner?  And you left your son with her?  Great thinking Dex.\n\nI didn't watch Dexter to see the bumbling misadventures of a limp dicked blood spatter analysist as he just wants to be happy with his girlfriend.  I watched it because Dexter was a cool, powerful monster in plain sight.  The story was smart and felt like it was going places.  Season eight is like a parody of Dexter that forgot that parodies were supposed to at least be funny.",

    "body": "Fully endorsing /u/electricfistula's great answer, and adding on.  Season 8 never felt like a final season.  So many new characters were introduced, just to be killed off.  Dr. Vogel's character, while brilliantly played by Charlotte Rampling, made no fucking sense.  Her connection to Dexter and Harry is ludicrous.  At no point in the series was she even hinted at.  To me, it was clear that the writers never envisioned this aspect of Dexter's myth when they created the show and the character, it was purely forced into place for this one season.  \n  \nThe other new characters also seemed to only be introduced to be killed so that the characters we've all come to know get to live (save Deb, who dies because of a one in a million blood clot- just so she and Dex can have one last conversation while she's in the hospital).  No other arc is closed.  Angel, Quinn, and Matthews are still in the dark about who Dexter really was.  This makes LaGuerta's death even more pointless than it already seemed.  Jamie still hasn't done anything important.  \n  \nThose things plus Dexter and Hannah turning into bumbling idiots as already pointed out turned the last season into a disaster.  The other HUGE GAPPING hole that was never addressed in either S7 or S8 was the scene in S5 where Deb walks in on Dexter and Lumen about to kill Jordan Chase (they can't see each other because of a opaque tarp) and Deb lets them go.  Suddenly Deb finds out Dexter is a serial killer and has this huge crisis of conscious.  In what universe does it make sense that the scene in the basement never comes up between the two of them???????????????",

It was simpler, more in your face etc.  Now that type of humor isn't bad, a lot of people like it, but part of why i liked community in the first place was the humor.  changing that to me makes it noticeably worse.  \n\nlastly i'll just briefly mention the tone.  a lot of it seemed more light heart-ed and not as heavy as some of the other seasons.  i remember episode one abed said \"that's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me\" after jeff said \"i see your value now\"  while it sounds funny at first that is some dark shit.  i don't remember anything like this from the fourth season.  this might just be my selective memory of the earlier seasons at the time though.  \n\nnow there were things they did that i think were better than all the other seasons, but overall my view of it is less than the others.",

It was similar to Intro to Felt Surrogacy in that each character had secrets that would upset the others and all those secrets were put on the table throughout the episode. In Felt Surrogacy, the secrets they each hold are of very different magnitudes. Troy started a 50 acre fire, while Jeff bailed on a date and felt bad about it. Everyone treats their secrets as if they have the same weight to them, and at the end they have a very sappy \"aww, we can all feel better about this now\" moment. In Cooperative Polygraphy each person's secret is given the appropriate weight. There character's secrets aren't just about things they did, but things they did to each other. There isn't a final moment of sappy sitcom closure where all the harm is undone and everyone hugs. Instead they grow as people. They realize that they're not as nice as they all might think of themselves being. Things mattered this time around.",

Off the top of my head from the first 3 seasons you have Paintball, the Bottle ep, the Xmas claymation, Halloween zombies, Paintball II, D&amp;D, the video game ep, and the alternate universe ep. Nothing from S4 comes to mind.\n\nOf course comedy is subjective but I don't think S4 has a single ep worthy of a top 10 and would be lucky to have one or two in the top 20. At the same time if we did a bottom 10 it wouldn't be all S4 or even half S4 so it isn't as bad as some make it. The difference is real however that S4 had no single brilliant 10/10 or even 9/10 episodes.",

When you are young, it is a social experience where you learn how to become friends with children of your own sex without the aid of your parents. As you get older, it is a social experience befriending (and other activities...) people of the opposite sex. I don't know if this makes camp all about \"acceptance,\" but it definitely makes the camp owners want to foster a friendly environment.\n\nIn regards to pranks, at my camp they used to be condoned; however, the pranks progressed year after year, become more and more vagrant (for lack of a better word). When my camp switched owners, the first year of under new ownership, a particularly ridiculous prank occurred (I wouldn't even call it a prank; some idiots stole candy from the Canteen). It was the owner's first year so he just put out a zero tolerance policy towards pranks and the lot. People still do them, but they are much smaller and more discreet than before. \n\nIn regards to protecting kids, I think a camp should foster a safe environment, especially for younger children. By age 12, most parents are okay if their children get hurt at camp (i.e. when they would get a call from the camp, they would say it happens), but for younger children (ages 8-11) parents were very scared whenever they heard their children were hurt. This is understandable and I this is why I accept trying to make camp a safe environment. At these young ages, camp is literally all about the activities to the kids; when they are older, camp is about the friendships and relationships they make. If the focal point of camp for these younger children doesn't appear safe to a parent considering sending their child there, then the camp would be failing one of its goals. \n\nThat's at least what I think about it anyway.",

Not everybody who finds themselves in a pit wants to be there. As well, when some asshole cold clocks you in the face (which happened to me in another pit) it stands to reason that you're going to be pissed. And I would imagine the majority of people you see whining or complaining fall into one of those two categories - over aggressive assholes pushing you into a pit, or over aggressive assholes hurting you on purpose in said pit.\n\nAnd to clarify, I have been in many pits willingly, and have enjoyed the majority of those occasions.

    "body": "Since the original text is deleted, here's the text form the original post:\n\nThrowaway account. \n\nFirst of all, I am a 24 year old male, engaged to my girlfriend (now fiance) of 6 years. We are in a great place and are getting married in October. \n\nLast night I went to my best friend's birthday party. My fiance is out of town til Tuesday. I arrived around 1030pm after pre-gaming with two other friends, so when I arrived I was pretty sloshed. I remember arriving. \n\nI also remember running into a girl, we'll call Mandy, I had known in high school. We had dated briefly and she was my first blowjob back then. Anyway. We caught up and all that, and I remember her being particularly flirty. I told her I was engaged and even showed her pictures of my fiance. Then, I went about my night. I remember my best friend pulling me aside and told me that Mandy was wanting to hook up with me, and was overly flirty. I was honestly pretty oblivious of her advances. \n\nAnyway, I kept drinking. Took several shots of Southern Comfort, and eventually blacked out. The only thing I remember after that is a quick flash of me vomiting out in the back yard. But something else happened. \n\nMy best friend said he walked upstairs to grab a towel, because someone had thrown up in his kitchen. When he opened the door, apparently Mandy was giving me a blowjob. I was apparently just lying there, looked like I was asleep. In his drunken state, he didn't think much of it, so he shut the door. \n\nI woke up the next morning around 7am, alone. My pants were completely off, and I still had my shirt on. I found out later from my best friend he overheard Mandy on her way out telling someone we had sex. I was completely blacked out, probably even passed out. I was definitely raped.\n\nI don't know what to tell my fiance. I'm trying to keep it under wraps. I'm afraid she won't believe I was raped. What do I do?\n\n**TL;DR** I was raped by an old flame at my friend's party. I have a fiance and I'm afraid of telling her in fear she won't believe me.\n\nEdit 1: Just called my fiance, told her I had something I wanted to talk to her about and not to worry. I just didn't want to pretend everything was normal til Tuesday. She is coming home early and will be back tomorrow evening. I've worried her, and now I'm even more afraid to tell her...\n\nEdit 2: Thank you everyone for your support. I'm still incredibly worried about telling my fiance. But it's gotta happen. I will post an update tomorrow night if I can. Honestly, I'm more worried about losing my love than I am hurt that it happened. I don't think I will need counseling, I'm a pretty level headed and rational person. NOT that people who do need counseling aren't! Just for me, personally, I don't think it would help much. Just a personal preference. Everybody copes differently. \n\nEdit 3: I just talk to my best friend. We both agree, it definitely appears I was raped. He says the more he think about it, the more he thought I was asleep or passed out when she was blowing me. He apologized for not stopping it, but was so drunk he just didn't think anything of it. He's willing to talk to my fiance is she needs proof. Also he is going to try and talk to Mandy soon. He's just thinking of a way to do it tactfully. I will also update with how that goes.\n\n[Source](http://np.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/2423ao/i_was_raped_last_night_im_engaged_im_a_man/)",

Those the consent is dubious not just because of the alcohol involved but also because I think there might not have been any consent whatsoever. \n\nFurthermore, on Mandy's part, if she's partying with the secondary intention of banging the OP even after he's made it completely clear while relatively sober that he does not want to have sex with her, she is entirely to blame. The OP's lack of consent was not just implied (through an absence of active consent) but actually explicit. Now it's possible that Mandy was drinking with no intention of banging the OP but that after enough alcohol, she couldn't control herself even though she expected she would be able to. Then perhaps she's not entirely to blame, but any residual blame goes to the alcohol rather than to the OP. \n\nNow, if you were to wake up in someone's bed after you had told that person explicitly while sober, \"I don't want to have sex with you,\" would you still be blaming yourself? Especially given that the other person initiated the act and you were too out of it to really do anything to prevent it?",

For A to have any defense, B would have at one point need to actively engage in the idea of banging which clearly didn't happen. \n\nLater B is so drunk that they black out. At this point, and even before, people are unable to consent to sex. Even if they say yes, it doesn't count because alcohol. At this point if anyone has sex with B it's pretty much rape (unless you get into the confusing situation where the other person was as drunk and both parties were fully involved in the act)\n\nA is possibly also drunk, but clearly able to still move around. A friend, C, witnesses B pretty much passed out and unresponsive while A performs oral sex.

    "body": "Korra had many disadvantages too. I don't agree that age and experience gave Korra a significant advantage because Aang traveled around the world and had more \"real life\" experience. Korra was confined to the Southern Water Tribe and had her teachers shipped to her while she didn't know very much about the outside world. Aang was fairly spiritual and able to easily get into the Spirit World while it took Korra most of the first two books to get to that point. \n\nI don't discount the struggle, but Aang certainly made things worse for himself. He would have had an easier time had he not gone into stasis. Assuming that he would be able to fend off the attackers at the Air Temples, the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom were not withered by the Hundred Year War. The Fire Nation had nowhere near the foothold on a global scale as they had a hundred years later so it would be easier for Aang to bid his time and train. Compare the \"final showdowns\": the very elderly Sozin with no combat skills other than bending and his successor who was just a baby, versus Ozai in his prime and his prodigy heiress who was literally one of the best benders in the world. There would also be a larger number of firebenders more sympathetic to the Avatar willing to teach him; he has friends in the Fire Nation. Basically, his potential allies would have been stronger before his stasis than after. \n\nI strongly disagree that his gang was ineffective. Team Avatar 1 literally taught Aang the other elements. Katara taught Aang after she surpassed his skill in the NWT and Pakku had nothing else to teach her, Toph taught him earthbending, Zuko mentored him in firebending. I can hardly call them ineffective when they taught Aang. Meanwhile, comic relief Bolin and angst Mako....yuck. They couldn't even hold off Desna and Eska at the spirit portals. \n\nLastly, I argue that Aang soldiered on because he felt that he had no other choice, but not because he truly wanted to.",

While you acknowledge the age gap and Aang's age at the time, I don't think you give him the leeway that he probably deserves.  \n\nIf we look at a 12 year old versus a 16 year old in our (or at least an American context), it's night and day.  While the 12 year old is struggling through the early stages of puberty, trying to find their way in 7th/8th grade, and beginning to learn about teenage life, the 16 year old is already living it.  While a person isn't necessarily super mature at 16, they are certainly going to be more mature than any 12 year old on average.\n\nHere's a kid who is born in desperate times, and expected to save the world.  That's pretty heavy if you're an adult, much less a 12 year old child.  I look back to what I was doing when I was 12 and I can tell you I wouldn't be ready to digest the notion of saving the world in a literal sense.  \nThis is because he does not want to kill, nor does he think he is capable of doing so.  I mean, he's scared too, but he doesn't know if he can beat Ozai much less kill him if he did win the fight.  Again, 12 year old.  Asking a 12 year old to perform the coup de grace is pretty gnarly.  It felt a little deus ex machina-like when the lion turtle gave him an alternate solution, but I had no trouble believing a young kid would be pretty freaked out by the implication that he had to kill someone.\n\nIn reality, Aang's whining is actually a pretty accurate portrayal of what an actual 12 year old acts like.  He has bursts of brilliance and is indeed more mature than most real 12 year olds, but his character was written extremely well.  Air nomads don't like to be held to one spot -- and by extension, I'd assume they wouldn't like to be held down by destiny.  Couple his background with his age, and you have a pretty darn good 12 year old character.\n\nIs he \"better\" than Korra? I'm not sure anyone can really settle that (not right now anyway).  However, I do think you're being a bit too harsh on Aang.",

    "body": "But that's precisely the point.  The difference in age of someone, say, 45 versus someone who is 49 is not going to be as vast as the difference between someone 12 and 16.  Both are 4 year age gaps, but the contrast is much sharper for the lower age pair.  Most people wouldn't bat an eye at, say, the 45 year old and the 49 year old getting into a relationship, but a 12 and a 16 year old in a relationship would be considered odd/wrong/etc.  Why?  Because a dearth in years means a lot more at that age.\n\nIt's not to say a 16 is fully mature, or isn't changing, or has nothing left to learn.  Far from it.  It just that it's even more amplified for someone even younger.  The average 16 year old would be much more mentally equipped to handle the stress and pressure of having to save the world than a 12 year old.  \nSure -- to a point.  If, say, one of your parents pass away when you are 12, it can certainly cause you to \"grow up\" faster, but it doesn't mean you're suddenly as mature as an adult.  Indeed, kids growing up in a wartime situation are probably going to be a bit more mature than similarly aged peace time kids, but they aren't adults by any stretch of the imagination. \n\nAt the same time, kids say some poignant things from time to time, and if a kid was raised by monks I'm sure their outlook would be heavily influenced by that.  Further, he is the reincarnation of the avatar.  He has no shortage of experience to draw from, and I don't think it always has to be in some dramatic fashion when he does so.  \n\nBasically, I don't really see any major plot holes/issues by having kids that understand the urgency of an important mission but still fall prey to the inexperience of their years.  I mean, like, watch a TED talk of some 14 year old trying to do something crazy/cool like provide cheap/clean water for people in Africa.  On one hand they certainly understand the gravitas of the water situation, want to help out, etc.  On the other hand, watching them present their findings/research/product clearly shows that at the end of the day they are still a young (or relatively young) child.  I don't see cognitive dissonance when I watch TLA because I know that kids *can* be simultaneously mature and immature.  \nI disagree.  Toph was very clearly demonstrated as having a rough and tumble demeanor, and yet was still sensitive and kind underneath.  Kids show writing aside, I don't believe Toph would be capable of killing someone in cold blood -- not at the age of 12 anyway.  \n\nI like Korra and the series, but I think TLA was better written.  If I had to take a stab at explaining why I think that, its that I felt TLA was more free to explore the world of Avatar, while LOK is confined to certain parameters set forth by TLA.  To me it's like the same reason fan fiction is never really as good as the original.  It doesn't mean none of it is enjoyable, but they are writing essentially a derivative work that has to fit in the confines of the existing world.  I'm sure they can certainly take some liberties, but the pioneering is largely done.  \n\nFor a more explicit example, take Harry Potter.  I'm guessing there's a good chance you've read them.  But in any event, while subsequent works can certainly be enjoyable and fun to read, any author (including Rowling herself) is bound by the original rules of the original series.  Any written work in that universe cannot (figuratively) be allowed to negate or trivialize previous struggles by inventing new stuff.  That is, if some later work introduced a new spell that would have trivialized Harry's struggles in the original 7 books, that's going to be *really* bad writing.\n\nThe same applies to LOK in my mind.  Not that it's written poorly, but now that TLA is canon, the writers have to be careful not to override anything (at least not without significant explanation/retconning).",

The series ends with him being a fully realized Avatar at the age of 12/13 and fully accepting his duties because he found a way to harmonize his beliefs with his duties.  \n\nKorra's character arc is completely different.  She's already done that. She realized she was the Avatar at the age of 4.  She was raised in peace time and security. \n\nAlso, lets look at what being the avatar meant to both Korra and Aang.  For Aang it meant losing all of his friends, losing his teacher, dedicating himself to years more training when he thought he only had to master one element, and fight a looming war with the dangerous fire nation. For Korra, it meant she was instantly elevated to the level of a celebrity. He family (which was already royalty from the Northern Water Tribe) gained even more prestige. She was given the finest teachers, and basically lived in luxury from birth to the beginning of the series.  Throw on the differences in age and training and I think it's really unfair to compare the two.",

The most compelling part of your argument is that 12 year olds can still say wise things, but you still cannot expect them to have the same moral agency as an adult even if they do act more mature than their age and participate in war. It's why juveniles and adults are not tried in the same courts in the real world. There are a few things here and there I don't agree with but they do not affect the integrity of your argument.

He's seen an astronaut in a movie, maybe, and thinks it looks cool. He has no actual understanding of what an astronaut does, or how rigid and dangerous is. He has no idea that when he turns 12 he's going to discover how much he  actually hates the boring work of astronomy and physics, and that he's not really into working out and prefers writing poetry. By the time he's an adult, being an astronaut is the LAST thing he wants to be.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's not 'genuine' when he said it as a kid. Kids are nothing if not genuine. What it means is that he said it in the way kids say all things: uninformed, mostly emotional, imitating adult behaviors and media depictions with little real understanding. From his perspective, he really does want to be an astronaut, and from an adult perspective, we know that's cute precisely because it's such a child's understanding of the world; that's why we say \"Awww\".\n\nChildhood crushes are the same way. Of course they're absolutely nothing like adult crushes. Of course kids have none of the vital information (like, say, their sexual preferences) that will shape their adult desires. A childhood crush is much more like \"play\", but to kids, play has all the emotional weight of real action. It's incredibly different from an adult crush, but that doesn't make it false or worse, lying to oneself.",

    "body": "ooooooh interesting question. I felt like I had a lot of crushes when I was a kid. I did the same things--the acting strangely, the telling good friends I had a crush on x, etc etc etc. I also remember obsessing about the crush object and imagining out all sorts of weird narrative scenarios where I have to rescue them or we both realize we're in love through some improbable situation. Strangely at the time it felt a lot like a medieval courtly love, like abelard and heloise--a feeling of intense devotion and obsession, the sense that material signs of love like kissing or dates would \"ruin\" it. So in that sense I agree with you, I think. I even worked up the nerve to tell one girl I liked her in 7th grade, after spending months building up to it, and when I finally did she said \"yeah, I know\" and my mind went blank and I had literally NO IDEA what to do next. Nothing happened and we continued being normal friends. \n\nBut even now (I'm 25 now) and I can get sort of obsessive about certain girls in the same way--just idealizing them and thinking about how great they are all the time and how they complete me. It's a mode of attraction which makes for a lot of unrequited love and, also, makes me act like an ass. This happens ESPECIALLY if I wait a really long time to make a move on someone I like. The way I see it, a crush is like an investment of hope. You dump some imagination into what it would like to be with that person, and then that image feeds you a certain shining. Even though it can slow action, because the reality of what that idealized person actually IS breaks through the illusion which sustains you for so long. ANYWAYS this is all to say while you're right that children don't have any sexual component to their crushes, the fantasy and imagination to evoke romantic feelings can still work. Kids develop those kinds of feelings early on through parental behavior, through culture, etc etc etc. What do you think?",

Once I got into my teens, he still had a lot of \"good will\" left over from when I first knew him so that I gave him a pass even though he was beginning to grate on me. As I got older, it became obvious that I didn't like him at all, and I found him to be untalented and annoying. \n\nAside from that, there are probably a lot of people who are predisposed to think good of him because of his politics. He would often speak a Democratic fundraisers, and was sympathetic to left-wing causes. \n\nSo while I don't think that I could ever convince you that he is actually funny, I think that those are some reasons why other people do (or at least *say* that they do).",

From the perspective of the characters, Arvo is a known liar, clearly hostile, has tried to escape, and has tried to have your group killed. It just doesn't make sense that so many of the characters go out of their way to help him. \n\nNevertheless, despite all the actions Arvo has taken against the group, they still try to help him. Arvo responds by shooting Clem. Now I think it's important to note that depending on your choices, at the time Clem was shot she would have been completely innocent.\n\nTaking my play through as an example:\n\n* Clem didn't steal from him\n* Clem didn't attack him\n* Clem had put her gun down when she was shot.\n\nArvo shot a little unarmed girl just because he was sad? Doesn't cut it for me.\nFirst off, I don't think we can overlook the fact that Lee was talking to an 8 year old. It seemed very obvious to me that he was sugar coating it a bit.\n\nRegardless, that isn't an excuse, and there are plenty of examples out there that show Arvo was a relatively bad person. \n\nChrista had more of a reason to blame Clem for Omid's death than Arvo had a reason to blame Clem for anything. She didn't take it out on her, or shoot her, she attempted to move and even took care of Clem.\nIt is implied that Lee's crime involved people really close to him, which led to a sense of betrayal and overreaction. It's definitely bad, but not the same as Arvo.\n\nWhat I think you are forgetting is that Arvo was a terrible person BEFORE all the bad stuff happened to him, and that he took out his anger on an innocent bystander.\n\nThe entire catalyst to his shitty situation was him putting Clem's group in mortal danger based on a lie.\n\nI'd even go one step further and say Kenny was right. It seemed really obvious that Arvo was going to try and kill someone. Had the group just been reasonable and listened to Kenny to begin with, then all the deaths in E5 could have been avoided.",

He didn't hate Mike or Bonnie; only Kenny (for obvious reasons) and Clementine (who killed his sister, and though even as you mentioned she didn't necessarily do anything wrong towards him afterwards, you never really got to make up with him like others did - thanks Telltale!).  \nHe did unto you what you basically did to him.   \nReally? I think everyone was reasonable to fear Kenny by that point. Except leaving the house with all your supplies was a dick move, but not trusting Kenny anymore wasn't wrong.

Ordinary civilians and bystanders can jump higher, run faster, and take more punishment than a normal human would be able to. For instance, Batman, an ordinary human at peak physical health, runs faster than Usain Bolt, regularly lifts more than the human world record, and recovers from injuries faster than should be humanly possible. The DC human brain is probably more shock-resistant than a normal human brain.\n\nIn Batman begins, Batman had every intention of having Gordon blow up the train tower which would cause the train to crash, and every intention of leaving Ra's al Ghul there to die. He said he wasn't killing him, he just wasn't saving him. That's just the same as Batman pulling the trigger on a gun and saying \"I am not killing you, the bullet is\". He made the plan, and executed it, knowing Ra's al Ghul would die.\n\nYou forget the point of Batman's no-kill rule. It isn't an arbitrary requirement he throws on himself for no reason. The no-kill rule is simply to hold himself back in the absence of public accountability, legal restrictions, or responsible partners (Robin is a kid. He doesn't count). When the cops fought Bane or when Gordon blew up the train tower, there were other people in the plot to ensure that Batman wasn't murdering out of petty revenge. The Batman can only kill out of absolute self-defense or under the eye of others to prevent himself from being the next Two-Face, Rorschach, or Ozymandias.",

However, I'll add in a point of view that shows that others are responsible or at least complicit in aiding the death of Kurt Cobain.\n\nDepression or drug use:\n\nIf an old person is at the top of a set of stairs walking down and her leg or hip breaks due to calcium deficiency. Because of this, she falls down the stairs and dies from the injuries. One would not say that the old person committed suicide. Blaming the death on the fall also not precise. It was the injury that should be blamed much as if another person pushed her down the stairs would be blamed.\n\nNow, instead of an old person its a person with depression. They're at the top of the stairs looking down and their mind breaks too much at that moment and they toss themselves forward. The injuries from the fall leads to his death. Do you blame the person, the fall or the mental injury?\n\nIt's the above reasons that insurance companies pay out for suicide so long as the policy is two years or older. We assume that taking out a policy just prior to suicide makes the act a conscious thought with hopes that the death leads to a cash reward to others. However, suicide as a result of mental illness is not considered a rational choice and death from that is considered as much an accident as falling down the stairs due to a physical injury. \n\nConsidering the above, you could say that killing one's self due to depression is not suicide but death due to illness. As such, given the evidence with Kurt Cobain, he did not commit suicide.\n\nEnabling:\n\nIf a person is depressed and taking illicit drugs and alcohol that exacerbates the problem, it can be deadly. Now, what about the people that know about that person's issues and callously ignores them and even offers to provide substances or enables the destructive behavior? I would argue that falls under reckless endangerment, and given the mental illness factor could be criminal in nature. \n\nWhile Courtney loved Kurt (actually, I don't know, but let's just assume so), her lifestyle continued to pull Kurt further and further down till his mind snapped to the point that he killed himself. She was the one that provided the push, and if she was not mentally ill herself can be responsible for the death of Kurt.\n\nConspiracy:\n\nNot touching that path.",

This is a story of an abandoned child doing his best to navigate his world without any kind of guide.  What's more sympathetic than that?\n\nAs far as my own personal love for the book, I can tell you that when I read it as a teenager, I had an epiphany-like experience of feeling like someone else in the world might actually understand me.  I was neglected, I was mentally ill and not getting treatment, and when Holden said it was the kind of cold where you felt like you were going to disappear every time you crossed the street, I thought *\"Oh my God, somebody GETS me.\"*\n\nThis book isn't for everyone, but for some people it is a profoundly validating experience.  Maybe you didn't suffer in the same way as Holden when you were a child.  Maybe you have a different kind of coping strategy, a different kind of resilience.

That was basically it. That is not, to me, an interesting character. The disjointed happenings the author used to beat those aspects of this character into my head for no other reason than \"because he's the main character\" were not something I found to be well written.\nIs a character that is insane supposed to suddenly *be* interesting to read about? My point is that all of his personality can be summed up by \"tragedy broke his mind and sent him into a spiral of idiocy and insanity.\" He was an insane hypocrite. That's all he was and that is utterly one dimensional.\n\nThere wasn't, as I recall, much of a showing of who he was before he lost his mind, so it doesn't even make for a compelling tragic tale to me. He was just some guy that suffered a lose and completely broke down in the most mundane, drawn out, and utterly frustrating way imaginable. I was a teen with depression while reading this book, and I've had people in my life die too.

This is my interpretation of the book, and we're here discussing it because our interpretations differ. But also, I dislike it specifically because it is my own opinion that it is poorly written. The fact that a lot of people have written a lot of things about it only proves it's popular, not that it's well written. Well written is just as much of a subjective idea, and I'm entirely aware of that.",

It was no different. we had some \"space\" themed classes that some people just dicked their way through, some payed attention too and others just used the time to flirt and mock other members of the group.\n\nI don't know where you fit in your own schools clique circle. I don't know how you would have handled it, but i was a nerdy kid, not an ostracized one, and it was a waste of time and money.\n\nthe education was geared towards an average grade level of 9 or so (i was in 7th grade at the time, most of the people attending where about my age or older) the \"experience space training\" was basically rides we could only go on twice.\n\nthe gravity jumper, [was basically bungee cords](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3415/3662223830_0b449f357c_z.jpg?zz=1)\n\n [the orbitron is something you can ride at most state fairs in texas](http://www.allaboutent.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gyroscope-ride.jpg)\n\n the accelerator training was a [centrifugal force ride](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_64wjUxIOxTc/TNAuIK0CqZI/AAAAAAAAAUA/AjHjkse2HSI/s400/Carnival+Zero+Gravity+Centrifugal+Force+Full+Circle.png) except not as fun. \n\n\nwe met astronaughts and went to a space museum, they showed us a pee/human waste catcher and played a \"prank\" by asking us to examine it and rub it against our faces, touch and smell it before telling us it was used to catch poo and pee.\n\nobviously the cool kids used this to mock everyone else, even though we all did it\n\nwe were not aloud in the scuba tank, but watched actual astronought trainees in it, we ate space food (which sucked) for 10 days\n\nwhen i went home, i told my parents it was great.\n\neven as a child i felt it was a terrible waste of money and time.\n\n\n\nI feel the one in Florida at least was a money making opportunity, not something that would benefit the people attending. we were part of a group of 50 over 10 days or so. (maybe 7 days of camp) with a total of about 8 from my own school.\n\nwe spent a few days in a hotel resolt and mall, i spent that time in a nearby arcade with little supervision. I thought that was the best part of the whole thing. \n\n\nMaybe mine was particularly poorly run. I still have a coat and a badge from the experience. first hand, personal experience, it was a waste of effort and money and the more i think of it the more i am convinced the school got a kickback or something for organizing and trip to the camp.\n\ni believe mine took place in november, just as it was getting cold, so maybe we got the B team, maybe we were the B team. \n\n\n\ni don't know if this would convince you, but as i kid, before i begged and pleaded and gave up allowances for 2 months to prove i wanted to go. and i regretted it deeply after.\n\ni don't care anymore. but jeeez, what a goddam waste. \n\n\ntl:dr - waste of money, a camp with a few carnival rides that was less educational than any given math, science or skill specific camp. difference is the branding and the cost. there is no increase in value, only on cost. if this was a \"i should have gone to camp. maybe, but i should have gone to space camp. it has the same logo as my nasa camp did, i suspect it was the same thing.   no added value.",

I'm not sure I can call it a field trip because I'm from Indiana and we went over the weekend. The group of students who went were people who wanted to go so it wasn't for a class. On the trip we buddied up with someone else and that person ended up being a good friend of mine throughout high school and I still keep in touch with him (I am one year out of college). \n\nHaving said all of that can you say that your trip would have ended up the same way or better? My enjoyment was due to the school trip and buddy system that was complete luck in it's pairing of myself and my friend. I also only remember two things about the entire weekend trip, which probably totals 20 minutes. My area of study and my career do not reflect an early interest in space or rocketry. Considering all of this, it is a nice memory but I cannot say my life is enriched by the experience. I have an interest in space now but that comes from other areas such as Neil Tyson, sci fi movies, and recent scientific events.\n\nI'm not saying it sucked back then like you want me to say but apparently it wasn't that great because I don't remember all that much about it. If your interest in science is making you reflect and wish that you went (you don't really give a reason), there are ways to get similar effects. Go to the National Air and Space museum in D.C. and watch an educational film in iMAX and there's most of Space Camp right there.",

Spending a day walking through the museum was the best part by a large margin.  I still enjoy that when I pass through Huntsville.\n\nTo put this into perspective, I entered a trivia contest at DragonCon in the late 90s.  I tied for 2nd with two others.  The top 3 got to have a play off with the top prize being a trip to adult Space Camp.  The 4th place prize was a $50 gift certificate to a local used bookstore.  I volunteered to take 4th because I preferred the gift certificate to the trip (and the second and third prizes).",

Have someone 50lbs your senior and 80 IQ points your inferior come at you like a raging bull. \n\nIf people can be trained and briefed on how to take down unarmed (or melee equipped) people with no concept of injury or harm in a blind rage without any collateral damage to the subject, he damn well could have handled it better.\n\nI'm not saying the officer had to react THAT severely, but he had full ability to get to non-lethal before jumping up to shooting him 12 times. If THAT was his reaction to THAT scenario, he is unfit to be an officer of the law with a lethal weapon capacity. I expect that my tax dollars do not go to hiring glorified town guards. I expect my tax dollars go to highly trained officers equipped with mental training to de-escalate violent situations and use the least amount of lethality in their responses.",

It's hard to read either account without noting that Wilson did not make it clear to the men what was taking place before initiating the altercation. Wilson had yelled from his window for the two to stop walking in the street, and was upset when they didn't immediately change course. He reversed to them, tried to open his door, but it shut back on him because he didn't have room to open it. So, Wilson grabbed Brown by the neck from his window and started lecturing him, though no one is sure of their conversation, this is when the scuffle started.\n\nThis cop didn't use his speaker or lights or follow any normal police procedures to let these guys know what was going on. I don't dispute that Brown scared him at some point, but he approached this in a way that escalates situations, not defuses them as police are trained to do. Had Brown not died, it's more likely he would have received punishment for how poorly this situation was handled.",

    "body": "Admittedly the facism thing was just bullshit. But here are some points we can move along on. \n\n1)Cops are trained to subdue people. This is true, but they are also trained to be physically fit, courteous/professional, and competent in the law. However, most cops rarely get more than 6 months of training. Taking into account that 6 months of doing anything puts the average person at a skill level of just above novice, we have to know what their abilities are. Cops will not be able to stop an assailant without causing serious injury or death. Just like anyone else, they are entitled to kill if an assailant presents them with the intent to harm/kill them. Police do not magically have the ability to subdue criminals.\n\n2)Killing someone is rarely the best option. But we hardly choose our circumstances, especially when our assailants force those circumstances on us. We have to recognize that police officers being attacked can not change circumstances simply because they have been trained. They are just like any other average person. And so they should be given the right to defend themselves just like any other average person.\n\n3)If cops should/ought to be the type of people to be able to prevail over these kinds of circumstances then we need to either extend the rights of the average citizen as to make the service of police obsolete or we need to extensively reconstruct the way we train police officers. I think that in order to satisfy your standard of what an officer should be able to do, we need to train them to be on par with special military forces. The problem with that is that we give the government a paramilitary force in small towns. \nImagine if you will: Police are trained to a standard such that they can physically subdue someone 100lbs heavier than them. Do we really want every police officer in our town to have that much power? Do we want government giving orders to such people? Police forces are already corrupt but now they have the physical power to act with impunity. I guess this is where my facism thing ties in.\n\nIn short, we either need to give more rights to citizens so that police are obsolete and we can avoid police brutality or we must train police to be on par with the military and risk giving government and police too much power.",

Obviously police cannot arbitrarily search people and places without a warrant or proper suspicion, which is part of our system of due process.\n\nHowever, if an individual is innocent and happens to match the profile of a suspect that just fleed the scene of a crime nearby, running away or tussling with the cop is not the appropriate response. There is a legal process to handle this. If someone just robbed a bank—or a convenience store—for example, the police should not just give up because the suspect isn't going to play nice and submit to questioning or arrest. If this happened, criminals would always just run away, and the police would be powerless because to do anything more would be to \"escalate.\"\n\nMichael Brown did not want to go to jail for what he had just done, I would imagine. In all likelihood, if he had submitted to arrest, he would have been in jail for a few hours—or a few days max until he was bailed out—and then given a fine, community service, and probation (of course he may have feared he'd spend the next six months in jail); his crime was not the most serious. Unfortunately, if the testimony and gunshot evidence is indeed all accurate, he doubled down on the stupid and decided to fight back against the police officer.",

He probably got out of the car and started shooting from where he was. I doubt he can shoot and run at the same time. If he was running after Brown he would have to holster his gun or run with his gun drawn, both of which would make him run more slowly than Brown who had a head start and probably in fear for his life.\n\nI believe the testimony that Wilson was shooting at Brown while he was running away, because it's the most reasonable explanation for why Brown turned around and put his hands up.\n\nSo from what I can piece together, Wilson was probably 30-40 yards away from Brown and Brown with his hands up, walking a few paces forward. If these are the facts then Wilson, a trained police officer, was clearly not in imminent danger.",

I also financed the rest. \n\nThe surgery was completely painless, but the week after that felt like I had a torn contact. It hurt, yes, but was very uncomfortable. That lasted about two weeks. Several times I had to pull over while driving to work because my eyes hurt so bad, but I'm photosensitive so the surgery isn't solely to blame. \n\nSince then my eyes have felt great. They were very good after surgery, but one eye has slightly diminished. The eye doctor told me that this will be a good thing in the next fifteen or twenty years and will prevent me from needing reading glasses. In the meantime I do not need contacts or glasses. \n\nI cycle and rock climb (and run, swim, weight lift, etc., etc.). Most things I enjoyed were impossible in glasses and as I got older it was harder to wear contacts. If you can afford the surgery I would recommend it. The younger you are the better investment it is.",

This meant losing/breaking glasses, spending time in the morning putting contacts in and out, worry about contacts before going to into a pool, etc. The cost of lasik well justifies getting rid of those hassles not to mention that the actual monetary savings. \n\nI remember for the first few weeks after lasik I would be just so thankful to wake up each morning having crystal clear vision. Its now become normal to me but even several years later it will pop into my head and I would think about how awesome lasik is. Cannot recommend it enough.\n\nThe one part of my experience that differed from the commenter above is that I never experienced dry eyes. Actually I differed a little from your post in that I really didn't have any pain either. Maybe lucky? I also paid significantly less than you stated (about half) but that was in part because I was referred to doctor by my sister. If you happen to live in Southern California I recommend the doctor.",

People that had a responsibility to report the incident (including Paterno) arguably did not do enough to 1) ensure that these incidents were properly investigated and 2) ensure that Sandusky did not continue to have unfettered access to victims.\n\nHowever, let's talk about the things that are questionable. People that arguably had the same (or a greater) requirement to report the incident in question were contacted by McQuery both before and after he met with Paterno. \n\nNow, let's talk about some things that weren't largely addressed in the media. Sandusky was not acting as a University official at the time of the incidents - he was acting as an official for the Second Mile, a charity organization that he himself founded. He used his access to the University to further the goals of this organization, but he was not a University employee - Paterno was not his boss and neither was Tim Curley. Despite this, both Paterno and Curley contacted superiors in regards to the incident (Paterno met with Curley the day after McQuery met with him; Curley met with Univeristy President Graham Spanier the day after that). \n\nCurley banned Sandusky from University facilities and also contacted the CEO of the Second Mile - the man who **was** Sandusky's boss, and comprised him of the incident. His response? He told Sandusky to wear shorts in the shower.\n\nNow, let's talk about the fact that *multiple people did not report the incident to law enforcement, despite a requirement to do so*. Within the entire chain, there are at least a dozen individuals who were apprised of a potentially criminal incident that should have contacted authorities, and yet they didn't. \n\nAt least three of Paterno's supervisors, Sandusky's boss at the Second Mile, and two board members from that organization had been informed about the incident.\n\nBut that's not all - a totally separate incident that went through an entirely separate chain of supervision (OPP - the division of the University responsible for maintenance) *had the same result.*\n\nDoesn't this point to a more systematic problem? One that perhaps goes beyond a single football coach? Isn't it possible that Paterno did what he thought was his responsibility, just like a dozen other people that were made aware of the incident?",

    "body": "First of all, Dale is a much better role model than John Redcorn. Redcorn is a womanizing, selfish, greedy (as evidenced by how he's willing to drop Luanne's Manger Babies from his VHS distribution company), and all around pompous person (he thinks his shitty death metal band is the greatest thing ever). He's also an extremely anger filled man, constantly discussing taking revenge on \"the white man\". \n\nDale, albeit a little crazy and paranoid, is actually kind, caring, thoughtful and above all else, selfless (remember when he saved the Stick-Tec office by killing thousands of roaches with his bare hands? Or when he rushed to save Joseph from the alien overlords at the Marfa Lights? Or the countless times he's shown his devotion and love for his wife?). The only thing Dale really dislikes is Bill, for being so pathetic and disgusting, and Rusty Shackleford, for totally made up reasons. \n\nSo it's much better for Joseph to grow up a little weird if it means he gets to learn good, quality values. The only thing he'd learn from John Redcorn is how to be a selfish asshole who fucks any woman he can in a vendetta against an entire race of people. \n\nWe also see that Joseph thinks John Redcorn is a pretty weird dude in the Thanksgiving episode, so I'm pretty sure going to live with him would be pretty damaging to Joseph. Not to mention that John Redcorn doesn't know the first thing about parenting.   \n\nAlso, sure John Redcorn might be hurt that he doesn't get to raise Joseph, *but that's the price you pay when you stick your dick in another man's wife*. Seriously, fuck John Redcorn. I'm glad he has to silently suffer while watching Dale raise his kid. He's a piece of shit, so the resulting harm to him is negligible.\n\nAnd as other people said, Hank typically stays out of people's personal business. Even if it's totally fucked up, he tries to keep personal details like sexual relations completely secret (he doesn't even like Luanne using the bathroom in his and Peggy's room). He would *never* broach the subject of intimate sexual relations with his friends - he avoids those conversations at all costs (watch the episode where Connie gets her first period for ample evidence of this aversion). \n\nHe also sees how destructive divorce can be, thanks to Bill. Hank sort of sees the value in \"ignorance is bliss\" at least when it comes to Dale. Bill at least has a steady paying military job. Dale would be homeless trying to live off of Dale's Deadbug (we're constantly reminded that Nancy is the breadwinner, and we see in the episode where Nancy goes to work in Dallas that Dale cannot take care of himself). So it's actually better for Dale to not be privy to the true father of Joseph as well. \n\nIf Hank told Dale, and Dale believed him (which is also a stretch), then it would ruin pretty much everyone's lives who are involved in it. Dale becomes homeless, Joseph is now a child of divorced parents who realizes at 13 that he's a different race than he thought, Nancy would have to deal with the publicity that would likely result from this, and John Redcorn's life as he knows it comes crashing down once he has legal guardianship over a child (no more banging sluts when he's gotta take Joseph to football practice).",

He doesn't go back to save Jessie, he goes back because he sees baby blue and thinks Jessie is working with the nazis. He has a change of heart only after he sees Jessie.

    "body": "Lame compared to what?  What is a finale that you found highly satisfying?\n\nThere are a couple reasons why these never live up to expectations.\n\n1) Once a show gets big, showrunners and the network are in a tug of war over how long it should continue.  Showrunners tend to want to end the show more quickly and efficiently, whereas the network wants to drag things out (because more episodes creates more money).  Breaking Bad is a good example of this.  You have the main antagonist (Gus) killed off in season 4, but there is still more airtime to fill, so the show has to build up a whole new (less intense and shorter) story with the White Power guys.  No finale in which Walt confronts the White Power guys could have been as powerful as the end of Gus.\n\nRelated to this is the Chekov's gun problem.  If you hang a gun on the wall in Act 1, someone has to fire it by Act 3.  As shows get dragged on in unnatural ways, especially shows with commercial breaks, you need to write in lots of cliffhangers, which often involve introducing new dimensions to the story (see: Lost).  This can easily get away for you and you end up leaving a bunch of loose threads or create continuity errors (see: Lost).  Breaking Bad ties up pretty much every plot and prop point though (i.e., the ricin).   \n\n2) Classically, narratives have a certain structure: rising action, climax, falling action, denouement (reflection).  In serial TV, the big problem is that everyone wants the finale to be a huge, blockbuster episode.  But, it isn't supposed to be.  You are supposed to have the huge climax sometime before the last hour of a 40+ hour story.  Really, the last episode should be pretty calm and character-driven (think everything in Lord of The Rings after they drop the ring in the mountain).    \n\nBreaking Bad actually dealt with falling action and denouement better than most shows.  You have the showdown in Ozymandias with Hank and, then a few episodes of Walt reflecting in New Hampshire.  But because the finale needs to have some sort of major climactic event, the show needed to build in the whole White Power showdown.  Basically, it is a very tough needle to thread, and Breaking Bad probably did it better than most.  Sopranos didn't even try.",

Only in that episode did he fully understand the extent to which his actions had ruined so many lives. He was taking his biggest skill - solving problems - and applying it to the purpose of atoning for his sins, in whatever small way he could. \n\nAs for the \"I did it for me\" speech: however thoroughly Walt had convinced himself that he was doing everything to provide for his family, the truth is it was fueled by greed, ambition, and a lifetime of feeling stifled and meek. It was entirely selfish of him to continue in the drug trade after the events of the first 3 episodes. That speech was the only time he was actually honest with Skyler - or anyone - about his motivations.",

That said-\nThis is true, which is why real world politicians tend to not make grand promises of what they will accomplish, but rather what they will fight for- with no guarantee of delivery.  Her campaign was run purely on hopes and dreams, and more than a few politicians have seen the end of their careers when they failed to deliver those.  Failure of this magnitude is a justifiable reason to seek a change in president, regardless of how realistic the goal is.\nThis is an illogical response, one born of emotion rather than reason.  Understandable, but not justifiable.  They are offering badly needed aid, that you arguably may not survive without.  It could be suicide to dismiss them, meeting them with violence could be costly, and trusting them explicitly would be unwise.  Therefore the rational solution is to accept their aid, but monitor them closely and limit their movement until you can be sure of their trustworthiness.  I believe that Adama satisfied these conditions in the initial standoff when they arrived.  Their interaction with the fleet was limited, and Galactica positioned itself with a lethal response ready at all times until their trust was earned by way of the testimony of trusted allies and deeds done by the Cylons.  Even then Adama was reluctant, but was pressed by circumstance to accept them.  Mind you, this is how they handled Athena when she returned with Helo.\nVery true.  At that point, their government bore little resemblance to a democracy and looked much more like a dictatorship, though I would argue this was necessary given the fragility of the fleet and responsibilities of its admiral.  Despite it's deeply negative stigma and undemocratic nature, martial law is not without its merits when used responsibly.\n\nNow here comes the part where I disagree with you- mutiny was not the answer.  I will admit that mutiny is a justifiable means in certain scenarios, but this was not one of them. \n\n* Firstly, Adama's actions were (mostly) neither unreasonable nor without their own justifications, which as I recall was communicated to the fleet.  His unofficial reign after Roslin's unofficial abdication was also very short before the mutiny, which was orchestrated by people with a long-standing grudge (Zarek and Gaeta).\n\n* Secondly, the primary spark was the presence of the Cylons who made every effort to be valuable to the fleet and nonthreatening.  As I said above, violent opposition to their presence was irrational.\n\n* Third, Adama and his loyalty had been proven multiple times at this point, having saved the fleet more times than anyone can count, and his judgement has proven sound throughout their years on the run.  The sudden change of opinion in the fleet was ignorant of this.  While it's not really reasonable to say he should never be doubted, it should have given far more pause than the colonists gave.\n\n* Finally, mutiny was a potentially self-destructive action.  Given the precarious position the fleet was in, a mutiny could have resulted in unnecessary loss of life (it did), loss of critical ships/resources/infrastructure, permanent damage to the survivability of the fleet and, by extension, the human race.\n\n**TL;DR**, Given the risks, Adama's track record, and irrational motivations, I find that while mutiny was not without cause, it was unjustified as a solution, especially above other options.\n\n-edit- words, etc.",

However I do think that not having to cut weight is something of an advantage at heavyweight.  Whether or not it's more of an advantage than size itself is debatable, but clearly most heavyweights don't bulk up to 265, and there are very few human beings that would have to cut down to 265 (unless they're fat obviously).  There seems to be diminishing returns on size once you get well over 200 lbs.  Ali wasn't that big himself, though he had a huge reach, much like Jon Jones, who many would have considered a favorite at heavyweight, even against the likes of Cain Velasquez.  It's extremely rare for fighters in other divisions to weigh in at less than a pound or two under the limit.  If UFC had a super heavyweight division I probably wouldn't give Lesnar as much credit.\n\nCain also has more losses in title fights, and what he may or may not do in the future is irrelevant.

It really could have been helpful for Poussey, she wanted to reach out but she couldn't because Suzanne was there to make sure she didn't 'snitch'. Healy still tried to change his behaviour and do something he thought could genuinely help the inmates.\n\nYou also have to remember that a prison counsellor isn't the same as a counsellor on the outside. A prison counsellor is not a therapist and may not even be able to tell someone is suicidal compared to being severely depressed, let alone provide the level of care needed for someone who is seriously considering suicide. His job isn't the same as an 'outside world' counsellor. He made a recommendation for Soso to get antidepressants, and without that recommendation she may not have gotten any medication whatsoever. Antidepressants have to be closely monitored by a medical doctor at the start of the course. That she didn't receive that care isn't Healy's fault, because he is not in any way qualified to monitor someone's reaction to medication, which often includes increased suicidal urges to begin with.",

He is supposed to be helping inmates, but he has been there a long time, and people who are in positions like that have something similar to battle fatigue where they become less compassionate and more suspicious of games.  \n\nI think that he realizes that he made some terrible moves in Season 1 &amp; the beginning of Season 2, and is trying/ did try to help.  He had that Circle group with Penn, and he tries to help Red when he can.  \n\nLike many people, he is actually a combination of decency and selfishness or pettiness.  \n\nHe may not be the best at his job, but he isn't the worst.  And in that system, sometimes the one who isn't selling drugs &amp; having sex with inmates, etc, is the one who is \"good\" at his job, by comparison.  \n\nAlthough, my vote for the one prison guard who seems to actually be good at his job would have to be Ford.

If the enemy is too weak, then there's no advancement; if the enemy is too strong, the Saiyan just dies.\n\nThus, Goku and Vegeta (and their children) are not exceptions to the rule at all, but rather extremely lucky to progressively face tougher foes on a step by step one-on-one basis.\n\nYou can see this window of opportunity *being missed* when Vegeta powers up after the Ginyu Force fight and is able to match first-form Frieza. Frieza transforms and gets stronger, and Vegeta simply loses. He survives with Dende's healing, and would be able to match second and third form Frieza for sure - but he fails again! Because Frieza's final form is just too strong. This is how most Saiyans would meet their end. He just happens to be revived by the Dragonballs later.\n\nSo the Saiyan race would not have simply all continued to get stronger to the point of threatening the universe. A great many of them would have gotten in fights over their heads and died; more would have picked on weaker races and failed to advance. Only a very small number of procedurally lucky fighters advance to levels like Goku and Vegeta.\n\nIn fact, Goku and Vegeta's luck ran out. They both died at various points. It's only the Dragonballs that are truly responsible for continuing their step-by-step slightly-stronger-enemy faceoffs. What we witness in DBZ is a race's tragic cultural flaw getting them into fights over their capabilities until they all get killed. Fighting people stronger than you is a Saiyan's best opportunity for advancement *and* greatest risk. Eventually, your luck runs out, and Saiyans were culturally bred to just be okay with that fact.\n\nFrieza couldn't count on luck, though. He saw their Zenkai enemy-matching ability and destroyed them to completely prevent it from getting out of control.",

    "body": "I suggest checking out the official patriots [rebuttal](http://wellsreportcontext.com/) to the Wells Report\nThere was  national media uproar about potentially deflated game balls.  If you were one of only a handful of locker room attendants who handled the balls, of course you would be interested if your name came up.  What kind of asshole would *not* tell his friend that his name came up in an interview with security. \nBrady knew he liked his balls at 12.5 psi.  He requested the locker room guys hand the refs a highlighted copy of the rule book so they knew what range it could be.  That requires inflating (and if necessary deflating if they've been over-inflated) the balls.  Needles are required for both inflating and deflating.\nThey claim they were referencing him trying to sell his game tickets.  But they claim the \"he\" that starts that quote wasn't referring to Brady.  It's one of the sketchier parts but is far from conclusive.\nThis was the week after the referees in a Jets game inflated the Patriots balls to 16 PSI, well over the legal limit.  Given that they were being yelled at for over-inflating the balls, discussing deflating would make sense.\nThis was in May 2014.  If they were deflating balls all the way back to the 2013-2014 season, then how did they end up getting surprised by 16psi balls during the Jets game in the 2014-2015 season?  They say it was a reference to losing weight.  The bit about ESPN was preceded by a discussion of getting free sneakers, which they were not allowed to do.  \nI would hope that Tom Brady and every major NFL star gives out signs gear for free for the lower-level team employees.  And, importantly, the Wells Report made no attempt to show that this was at all unusual for the Patriots or for NFL teams in general.\nYeah, guys whose job it is to inflate the balls need needles to work the pumps.  The request for cash clearly sounds like a joke, especially in the context of the rest of their text message jokes. \nAgain, players sign all kinds of stuff, I don't see any reason to suggest this was some kind of quid pro quo.  Unless you hear players or employees saying that it's rare for players to sign all kinds of stuff and give away used equipment, I don't think this is any evidence of anything.  And these were the guys who prepared his game balls.  It's important to keep those guys happy.  \nOk, admittedly destroying the phone was a bad idea, but: A) At that point, he wasn't going to give it to them anyway, so destroying didn't do anything to cover up actions. B) If Brady's lawyer were the one selecting which messages were relevant, then I don't really see how they were expecting to get any incriminating evidence of the phone anyway.  C) I think his claim that he didn't want to set a precedent of players having to turn over private cell phones or private text conversations is legit. D) Around the time of the appeal (although a bit too little, too late) he pulled the records of his text messages and said he was willing to attempt to recover the contents from the other peoples' phones.\nThe AFC championship game was unusual in the sense that it was delayed due to the late ending of the NFC championship game.  As a result the pregame timing was a little different, and the Officials Locker Room was crowded with people watching the end of the other game.",

There is a mountain of circumstantial evidence (but no direct evidence) suggesting that McNally deliberately deflated the Patriots footballs, and that Tom Brady knew about it.\n2. The Patriots footballs were not deflated.\n\nThese points are diametrically opposed and mutually exclusive. Only one of those two things is true.\n\nYou detailed all the aspects of Point #1. It's an incredibly compelling story, filled with drama. There's a villain, there's a conspiracy, there's a fall from grace. It's awesome.\n\nPoint #2 is much more mundane. The Patriots balls were at 12.50 PSI before the game, they lost 1.01 PSI due to the cold weather, and that's that. It's a boring explanation.\n\nIt's science versus faith.\n\nPoint #1 has a lot of vague inferences that you can interpret however you like. You choose to interpret them to mean that footballs were deflated; I interpret them another way. Regardless of interpretation, the story doesn't have an \"I prefer footballs below 12.5\", or \"I'll deflate the footballs\", or security footage of deflation, or a confession, or any witnesses at all. There is no direct evidence. You can make your interpretations, and have faith that they're correct.\n\nPoint #2 is pure science. According to the Ideal Gas Law, the Patriots footballs should have lost between 0.98 and 1.18 PSI during the first half *if they were not deflated*. They lost 1.01 PSI. Therefore, they were not deflated.\n\nI'm not trying to change your view, I just want to point out the difference between the groups, and make it clear which group you are in.",

    "body": "The patent system as a whole is good (including software patents). The only problems with the patent office today is that it grants patents that are later found to be invalid, and that some patents last too long. CMV\n\nThis post will focus on software patents since that is what I am most familiar with.\n\nI think that the patent system should serve two purposes: rewarding effort, and providing incentives for innovation, and that it currently does that. Some of the problems people often bring up in the current system are:\n\nPatents are granted for things that are too easy to create: I think that the expiration date for a patent should be set by the examiner and should be dependent on the investment that went into developing the technology. Drug patents that require billions of dollars of research can continue to have long terms. Software patents that require half a year of research by a few people will have shorter terms. This is not a major overhaul of the system, and supports the goal of providing incentives for innovation by forcing companies to continue to innovate if they want to have exclusive access to technology (and all the financial benefits that gives).\n\nPatents are granted for things that have already been invented: These patents should not be granted. This is not a change to the current system.\n\nPatent trolls are a thing: If the patents being used to 'troll' are legitimate, I think this is not a problem, due to the goal of rewarding effort. I think that a person who is a skilled inventor but unskilled at manufacturing, distribution, marketing, or all the other things necessary to make money from an invention should still be rewarded for his invention, by selling the right to use his invention to other companies. Or, he should be able to outsource the selling part to people who are good at that, while he continues doing what he is good at, which is inventing.\n\nPatents are granted on math: Allowing patents on math helps provide both stated goals of the patents system. If someone discovers or create a new algorithm or formula, they should be rewarded for it, even though it is \"Just\" math.\n\nTo the people who think that all patents should be abolished, or that all patents within a certain industry should be abolished: I think that would result in a return to the days of trade secrets, which I would consider to be a very bad thing, and result in more incentives to protect your secrets than incentives to innovate.\n\nTo change my view you must either show that your proposed change to the patent system will further the goals I’ve provided for the patent system, or you must change my view on what the goals of the patent system should be.",

After looking at the conclusions reached by the Warren Commission, I was somewhat skeptical of the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, but the HSCA report clarifies some of the issues surrounding the timing and circumstances of the assassination, and leaves open the idea that Oswald may have had a partner. Additionally, I do feel that the events following the assassination are slightly suspicious (notably LBJ appointing and overseeing the Warren Commission), but are not at present sufficient for me to discount the accepted explanation of the assassination.  The number of conspiracy or alternate theories surrounding the assassination is prodigious and confusing, to say the least, but I am willing to accept an alternate theory and CMV if someone can present a compelling alternate explanation of the JFK assassination supported by clear and provable facts.",

For some reason, Daniel just snaps and goes Heisenberg the second H.W. loses his hearing.  Daniel's character is pretty much pointless after H.W. loses his hearing.  Now onto Eli.  Eli is a little whiny bitch.  Seriously, how does he have a following?  He has the worst public speaking voice ever, honestly, he sounds like a 4 year old having a temper tantrum.  I could see him having an actual following if he had a deeper voice, or had a more Hitler style of giving sermons.  Eli doesn't really serve any purpose after Daniel bought the land.  H.W.  H.W. is pretty much just Daniel's cute face, which at least Daniel admits, but he's really not relevant to the plot in the least and doesn't even need to exist.  Henry.  What the fuck was the point of that?  If there's any characters who I missed, well, they weren't memorable then.\n\n* Plot/Narrative:  There doesn't seem to be one.

So many people give it such high praise, and I don't even understand why.

    "body": "I thought Alien 3 was a good sequel. CMV\n\nI'll try and justify it with these reasons (which also stop many of the arguments I usually hear against it)\n\n* The soundtrack was just amazing, the slow paces for moving scenes and the impending crescendo for when Weyland Yutani arrives was some of the best I've ever heard (Eg, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ckg2RaCpTI#t=158))\n\n* The death of Newt and Hicks... boy oh boy is this a tough one to defend. Although it makes Aliens seem pointless, an earlier draft of the script shed some good light on it: Newt was going to be a host to an alien, and would have died in either agony of her chest exploding or her surroundings exploding - instead her last memories and feelings were safety and security in the Sulaco, and she would've died in peace. The same can be said for Hicks. From a practical standpoint, it also helped move the script along - if they had both survived, how many other ways could a potential sequel 'end' without Ripley saving Newt? It also fits the Alien franchise rather well - the Xenomorphs being without conscience or remorse, taking away everything. \n\n* It was the most original of the Alien movies. Out of the 4 sequels, how many ended with Ripley blasting the last Alien out of a spaceship? The first, second, and fourth (If you'd call that a xeno) Rather than copy the first two films, it went down a different direction with a dark prison-y environment. A bald Ripley certainly made for a different change (Her hair is almost a metaphor, long for innocence in Alien, short for anxiety and confidence in Aliens and no more for Alien^3 , showing she had lost it all and accepted it), this one brought closure for Ripley. \n\n* She was finishing off the Xeno's by killing herself and spiting the company that made her lose everything trying to get it, the most sensible and plausible ending in a universe like this\n\n* The cast was great. From everyday truckers to cocky marines, a British cast of prisoners was a great idea for the next installment. ~~Tywin Lanister~~ Charles Dance made an excellent addition to cast as well as Charles Dutton, along with other heavyweights like Pete Postlethwaite in the mix. The funeral scene was the most poignant moment in the whole series IMO.\n\n* The sets and backgrounds looked great, despite the actual alien. Yes I will admit the Alien looked very CGI (although it was a puppet added over the film), the brooding planet and almost goth-like prison halls were a nice theme and very fitting for a murky alien.\n\n* The alien itself made for a smart change too. From a general soldier to a Queen, the 'runner' or dog/ox-alien was an interesting take on it. (And would also become cannon regarding aliens taking on their hosts form for the expanded universe)\n\n* One of the most important things I noted about it was the genuine reactions people have to it. When watching Alien people would exclaim \"Man I'd *shit* my pants in that situation\" or in Aliens they would cry \"WHOO GAME OVER MAN BREAK OUT THE BIG GUNS\" but would react exactly as intended to Alien^3 like they were in the movie. \n* As for the plothole about the eggs on the Sulaco, I think the Queen in extenuating circumstances would lay a few eggs as an emergency safeguard for the population. One would certainly be a Queen with a few others to guard it. These eggs did not have time to mature like the ones in the Queen Sack (ick) So after a while in the landing gear on the dropship, these eggs may be wired to actively search nearby hosts due to the urgency. *OR* they may have been moved by an automated system on the Sulaco to move organic material, even the possibility the company intended this from long distance.\n\n* Although the first two movies are fantastic, they could be a little bit limited at times - if you step back to look at it, the ending of Aliens with Ripley fighting off a Queen with a free tail and arms should be impossible, but was overlooked cause she was being a hero. In this movie she was a lot more human.\n\n* Not necessarily horror or action, I think this is almost borderline Sci-Fi Drama\n\nAll in all I thought it was a worthy sequel to the first two and concluded the series nicely. Alien Resurrection was a bit meh, no where near the same par.",
