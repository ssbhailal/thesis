    "body": "But does anything function alone with no other built in factors? For example, in high school debate there are two key factors that are used- How you say it (speech) and what you are saying (facts, arguments). But the majority of it for debate is how you say it so I'll take it instead that the majority of success will have to be because of luck or who you know instead of being able to do something or talent. \n\nLucky is defined by having good luck, luck being the force that seems to operate for good or ill in a person's life, as in shaping circumstances, events, or opportunities. I'll give 2 examples: one with a lot of luck but no talent and another one with a lot of talent but no luck. 1. Jim lands a job interview that he recently found in the paper the second he opens it. He goes to the job interview with all of his charm and best clothes. He finds that this attractive redhead is doing the interviews, seemingly her first time to be doing this so she is relatively laid back. Jim goes in her interview and does perfectly! He already knows all of the questions and talks in a smooth voice.  Now there is a portion to show coding.  After about 5 minutes she realizes that he doesn't know anything and tells him sorry. Now Bob walks in to another room that has a grumpy old man sitting there.  He asks the most difficult questions possible! Luckily as Bob is an experienced person with interviews and a talented coder, he answered the questions to the best of his ability and later blew the interviewers mind with his coding abilities. \n\nBob gets the job because of his experienced talent of interviews and amazing coding abilities that gets him through. Jim does not although he did perfectly with the easy questions but proved terribly in coding on the computer.",

There are lots of people that come across good opportunities, but many of them are either unprepared for them or do not pounce on them when they appear so the luck is squandered.\n\nThe extremely successful position themselves to take advantage of every lucky break that comes along.\n\nSo this isn't exactly a refutation of exactly what you said. But perhaps it might change how you view luck in a more general way. A lot of times the more successful didn't have more luck than others, but they were able to better take advantage of the luck they had.",

Seemed to me as just people who were drug addicts / alcoholics / etc. so anyway back to volunteering at the shelter. I ended up talking with a few guys about their lives and pasts and it was fascinating the things that they had done and also the unfortunate circumstances / decisions that led to where they are now. I also ended up playing a 3 hour game of chess which ended in a stalemate. Most of these guys were really intelligent and it surprised me to some degree. Anyway after that my view of those who are homeless has shifted a lot to seeing each person as an individual with their own unique past and not simply as a collective of people who are homeless, and that there are a lot of hard working homeless people out there who have jobs and families but they just can't afford the cost o living.",

The best solution would have been to uncuff the owner for a little second to secure the dog.  The owner wasn't violent and not a threat to the police, you can see he immediately complied when they asked to cuff him.  \n\nEven if they aren't going to uncuff a suspect, all cops have at least one form of non-lethal force.  Either a taser or pepper spray.  They also have training into when it's appropriate to use non-lethal vs lethal force.  Either one of these would have worked fantastically at taking down a dog, but the officer came over gun-drawn to deal with it.  Why did he need his gun out?  Why didn't he have his taser out instead?  Was there some situation where he thought he would need a gun going on there?  Clearly he made a major mistake in deciding what type of force to use.",

You are going to be running off of instinct, it's like how a drowning man will try to pull down someone who is trying to save him. Also, I've heard that since there aren't any certifications for martial arts, it's a big issue that there are scams which aren't really teaching anything useful but this was from a cracked article so take it with a grain of salt.\nWell the thing is, Trayvon probably wasn't but that doesn't mean Zimmerman is lying. He was placed in a high stress situation and it isn't unreasonable that he could have thought trayvon was reaching for his gun for whatever reason. In hindsight, this might not have been true but self-defense claims don't require him to have perfect knowledge of the situation.",

Then, the scuffle took place, but have you seen Zimmerman's face after the \"pummeling\"? No damage to his eyes, cheeks, fine a broken nose, but getting beaten to death? Nope, Zimmerman's lying about that. \n\nAlso, why should we simply believe that Zimmerman didn't START the fight? I love how people just simply assume Zimmerman's version was right, without questioning whether he shoved the teen (a violent act, but not one that would show in the autopsy). \n\nAlso, if he's getting beaten to death, he shoots a perfect shot to the chest, WITH someone on top of him waling on him with deadly punches??\n\nAs for the following, there's a conservative, a respected one who agrees with me.\n\nConservative intellectual George will echoed the same sentiment:\n\n\"Mr. Zimmerman says he was acting under this self-defense law, but he is said to have been recorded saying he pursued the person. You cannot be in pursuit and acting in self-defense.\u201d\nhttp://www.mediaite.com/tv/george-will-on-trayvon-martin-stand-your-ground-law-is-a-bad-idea/\n\nFinally, if I'm armed, and this is just me, but I'm going to make sure that I'm a distance from a potential threat, so that I can draw the weapon. I'm not getting inches away from someone who could hurt me, or prevent me from grabbing the gun. But then again, that's me, obviously Zimmerman \"somehow\" knew, without warning the kid that he was armed, that he'd be able to both confront the potential \"perp\" in close proximity, possibly get into a fight, but also miraculously pull his gun out without a problem.",

    "body": "If we believe Zimmerman's statements, and the police as well as a jury found no apparent reason not to, Zimmerman did not know Martin's race when he began following him. What attracted Zimmerman's attention was a man wearing a hood walking between houses at night, in a neighborhood that had been troubled by burglaries.\n\nLets put this another way. Is there any actual evidence to suggest that Zimmerman is a racist? This seems to be an assertion that's being made between the lines without any real support. \nSadly, yes. I'd say it's conditional: an older, clean-cut black man wearing a suit? No. A young black man wearing certain kinds of fashion, sporting tattoos and gold teeth? Yes. Is that racist? I'd argue no. Is it a form of prejudice? That's arguable - clothing and manner of dress are used for a variety of reasons, but one being to signify a certain set of beliefs and values, an adherence to a certain social \"code\". \n\nThe fact is that inner city/ghetto culture in this country has rightfully earned a reputation for thuggish behavior. It isn't George Zimmerman's fault that if you open a hip-hop club in a city, even in a nice neighborhood, you have to pay for ten times more security and still deal with a higher frequency of fights and gang activity. That's just a fact, and we can either own up to it and figure out how to deal with it, or we can go off into some hippie-dippy la-la land of ignorant political correctness. It isn't a matter of skin color, it's a matter of cultural mores and values promulgated by different quarters of society. But it is an important matter that needs to be addressed: the epidemic of violence in the inner city is claiming a lot of lives, and costing a lot more their livelihoods. If we really care about our children and our countrymen, we will summon up the courage to stop looking for scapegoats and face up to this serious problem. Trayvon Martin, who by all accounts knocked a guy onto the ground and then continued beating him mercilessly, is a sad victim of this culture, as are *so many* young black men and women. Look at the homicide rates in Chicago, look at the faces of the victims. Look at the perpetrators... it's not a bunch of George Zimmermans.\n\nI feel tremendous sympathy for the kid's family. I feel tremendous sympathy for the kid himself... he could be so many kids I grew up with, called friend, ate dinner with. We've all made mistakes, and you and I, dear reader, are still here to talk about it, able to learn from them and carry on with our lives. Sadly, Trayvon isn't still with us, and will never have that opportunity to learn from mistakes. He didn't deserve that fate. \n\nBut the reality is that George Zimmerman is not ultimately to blame for his fate... George Zimmerman had no other choice, if we take a rational reading of events. Anyone who says they would passively lay there and let themselves be pinned to the ground and beaten into unconsciousness or worse on the street is either lying or hopelessly naive, and probably both. What's to blame for Trayvon's fate is a culture that teaches our young men that they are not men unless they solve their problems with violence, that respect is synonymous with beating people up, and using your words and your head instead of your fists is cowardly, and that running away from a meaningless confrontation is a shameful act rather than a wise one. It's a fate that will continue to befall an unfortunate number of us, and disproportionately those of us who are black or poor or from the 'hood, until we steel ourselves to confronting the real problem.",

All \"evidence\" for a second shooter can be explained away in a very logical way. I've also heard a second hand account of a conversation a friend of mine had with the marksman instructor who trained Oswald in the military. He testifies Oswald was a good enough shot.\n\n- We'll likely never know if Oswald was hired, but I believe he was hired by a friend of Communism, either a government (Russia, Cuba) or group (Communist Party members), most likely Russia. Kennedy was a threat because I believe Russia feared him escalating the Cold War into an actual war, and despite their hard attitude, they didn't want a nuclear war either.\n\n- I believe the Mafia thought they would be blamed, as they weren't too fond of Kennedy, and so they were happy to help out when asked to kill Oswald in revenge. They never knew, but the same people who hired LHO hired them. They chose Ruby because, he loved America, and he was terminal. He didn't have long anyway, so he was a low risk to talk. Once Ruby dies in prison, all loose ends are tied.\n\n- No one within the American government was involved. It was not an inside job.\n\nAgain, I draw these conclusions based on what I've read. There are \"experts\" out there who would agree this is all plausible. What do you think?",

Okay, you\u2019re starting to convince me that there was more at play than I initially suspected, but I have a few more questions that you might be able to clear up.\n\n* You\u2019ve convinced me that Oswald acted alone, or at least plausibly could have made the shots that killed Kennedy and wounded Gov. Connally. Re-examining the distance Oswald was shooting from and the fact that he did actually miss twice, it fits that someone with his marksmanship skills would\u2019ve done poorly but still hit his target.\n\n* I\u2019m still skeptical about why a communist group would want to kill JFK. You\u2019re right to point out that post-assassination most of the American public was more concerned with the effect the attack had on domestic affairs and the personal lives of the First Lady, etc. Yet that ignores the fact that LBJ immediately succeeding Kennedy led to increases in tensions with the USSR both in the short term and more over in the long term. I still don\u2019t see why communist groups would want to kill Kennedy in Dallas; why didn\u2019t they kill him around the Bay of Pigs or the Cuban Missile Crisis? I also feel like you brush off them trusting Oswald; if he was actually hired and then apprehended, he would have still had plenty of time to tell one of the Dallas police officers or FBI agents who interrogated him for several hours at least some degree of information about who had hired him. Sure, the FBI might have thought he was a nut, but in the immediate aftermath of a presidential assassination, I seriously doubt that they wouldn\u2019t have followed up on every piece of information he provided, regardless of how crazy it sounded (and communists hiring an assassin in the political climate of the early 60\u2019s isn\u2019t that crazy). Sure, Oswald *didn\u2019t* rat on the people who hired him (aside from saying he was a \u201cpatsy\u201d) but the odds that he *might* have still seem to me to preclude a communist group from hiring such a lose cannon (who, again, defected *away* from the USSR despite initially professing his love for the Soviets).\n\n* If you can convince me on the Russia/Communist angle, I\u2019m starting to buy the next link in the chain, of Mafia involvement. That said, I don\u2019t see the evidence in your argument for Mafia involvement. Sure, they *could* have, and I see their motivations, but what is your actual proof for Mafia involvement?",

When you are young, it is a social experience where you learn how to become friends with children of your own sex without the aid of your parents. As you get older, it is a social experience befriending (and other activities...) people of the opposite sex. I don't know if this makes camp all about \"acceptance,\" but it definitely makes the camp owners want to foster a friendly environment.\n\nIn regards to pranks, at my camp they used to be condoned; however, the pranks progressed year after year, become more and more vagrant (for lack of a better word). When my camp switched owners, the first year of under new ownership, a particularly ridiculous prank occurred (I wouldn't even call it a prank; some idiots stole candy from the Canteen). It was the owner's first year so he just put out a zero tolerance policy towards pranks and the lot. People still do them, but they are much smaller and more discreet than before. \n\nIn regards to protecting kids, I think a camp should foster a safe environment, especially for younger children. By age 12, most parents are okay if their children get hurt at camp (i.e. when they would get a call from the camp, they would say it happens), but for younger children (ages 8-11) parents were very scared whenever they heard their children were hurt. This is understandable and I this is why I accept trying to make camp a safe environment. At these young ages, camp is literally all about the activities to the kids; when they are older, camp is about the friendships and relationships they make. If the focal point of camp for these younger children doesn't appear safe to a parent considering sending their child there, then the camp would be failing one of its goals. \n\nThat's at least what I think about it anyway.",

    "body": "Korra had many disadvantages too. I don't agree that age and experience gave Korra a significant advantage because Aang traveled around the world and had more \"real life\" experience. Korra was confined to the Southern Water Tribe and had her teachers shipped to her while she didn't know very much about the outside world. Aang was fairly spiritual and able to easily get into the Spirit World while it took Korra most of the first two books to get to that point. \n\nI don't discount the struggle, but Aang certainly made things worse for himself. He would have had an easier time had he not gone into stasis. Assuming that he would be able to fend off the attackers at the Air Temples, the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom were not withered by the Hundred Year War. The Fire Nation had nowhere near the foothold on a global scale as they had a hundred years later so it would be easier for Aang to bid his time and train. Compare the \"final showdowns\": the very elderly Sozin with no combat skills other than bending and his successor who was just a baby, versus Ozai in his prime and his prodigy heiress who was literally one of the best benders in the world. There would also be a larger number of firebenders more sympathetic to the Avatar willing to teach him; he has friends in the Fire Nation. Basically, his potential allies would have been stronger before his stasis than after. \n\nI strongly disagree that his gang was ineffective. Team Avatar 1 literally taught Aang the other elements. Katara taught Aang after she surpassed his skill in the NWT and Pakku had nothing else to teach her, Toph taught him earthbending, Zuko mentored him in firebending. I can hardly call them ineffective when they taught Aang. Meanwhile, comic relief Bolin and angst Mako....yuck. They couldn't even hold off Desna and Eska at the spirit portals. \n\nLastly, I argue that Aang soldiered on because he felt that he had no other choice, but not because he truly wanted to.",

While you acknowledge the age gap and Aang's age at the time, I don't think you give him the leeway that he probably deserves.  \n\nIf we look at a 12 year old versus a 16 year old in our (or at least an American context), it's night and day.  While the 12 year old is struggling through the early stages of puberty, trying to find their way in 7th/8th grade, and beginning to learn about teenage life, the 16 year old is already living it.  While a person isn't necessarily super mature at 16, they are certainly going to be more mature than any 12 year old on average.\n\nHere's a kid who is born in desperate times, and expected to save the world.  That's pretty heavy if you're an adult, much less a 12 year old child.  I look back to what I was doing when I was 12 and I can tell you I wouldn't be ready to digest the notion of saving the world in a literal sense.  \nThis is because he does not want to kill, nor does he think he is capable of doing so.  I mean, he's scared too, but he doesn't know if he can beat Ozai much less kill him if he did win the fight.  Again, 12 year old.  Asking a 12 year old to perform the coup de grace is pretty gnarly.  It felt a little deus ex machina-like when the lion turtle gave him an alternate solution, but I had no trouble believing a young kid would be pretty freaked out by the implication that he had to kill someone.\n\nIn reality, Aang's whining is actually a pretty accurate portrayal of what an actual 12 year old acts like.  He has bursts of brilliance and is indeed more mature than most real 12 year olds, but his character was written extremely well.  Air nomads don't like to be held to one spot -- and by extension, I'd assume they wouldn't like to be held down by destiny.  Couple his background with his age, and you have a pretty darn good 12 year old character.\n\nIs he \"better\" than Korra? I'm not sure anyone can really settle that (not right now anyway).  However, I do think you're being a bit too harsh on Aang.",

    "body": "But that's precisely the point.  The difference in age of someone, say, 45 versus someone who is 49 is not going to be as vast as the difference between someone 12 and 16.  Both are 4 year age gaps, but the contrast is much sharper for the lower age pair.  Most people wouldn't bat an eye at, say, the 45 year old and the 49 year old getting into a relationship, but a 12 and a 16 year old in a relationship would be considered odd/wrong/etc.  Why?  Because a dearth in years means a lot more at that age.\n\nIt's not to say a 16 is fully mature, or isn't changing, or has nothing left to learn.  Far from it.  It just that it's even more amplified for someone even younger.  The average 16 year old would be much more mentally equipped to handle the stress and pressure of having to save the world than a 12 year old.  \nSure -- to a point.  If, say, one of your parents pass away when you are 12, it can certainly cause you to \"grow up\" faster, but it doesn't mean you're suddenly as mature as an adult.  Indeed, kids growing up in a wartime situation are probably going to be a bit more mature than similarly aged peace time kids, but they aren't adults by any stretch of the imagination. \n\nAt the same time, kids say some poignant things from time to time, and if a kid was raised by monks I'm sure their outlook would be heavily influenced by that.  Further, he is the reincarnation of the avatar.  He has no shortage of experience to draw from, and I don't think it always has to be in some dramatic fashion when he does so.  \n\nBasically, I don't really see any major plot holes/issues by having kids that understand the urgency of an important mission but still fall prey to the inexperience of their years.  I mean, like, watch a TED talk of some 14 year old trying to do something crazy/cool like provide cheap/clean water for people in Africa.  On one hand they certainly understand the gravitas of the water situation, want to help out, etc.  On the other hand, watching them present their findings/research/product clearly shows that at the end of the day they are still a young (or relatively young) child.  I don't see cognitive dissonance when I watch TLA because I know that kids *can* be simultaneously mature and immature.  \nI disagree.  Toph was very clearly demonstrated as having a rough and tumble demeanor, and yet was still sensitive and kind underneath.  Kids show writing aside, I don't believe Toph would be capable of killing someone in cold blood -- not at the age of 12 anyway.  \n\nI like Korra and the series, but I think TLA was better written.  If I had to take a stab at explaining why I think that, its that I felt TLA was more free to explore the world of Avatar, while LOK is confined to certain parameters set forth by TLA.  To me it's like the same reason fan fiction is never really as good as the original.  It doesn't mean none of it is enjoyable, but they are writing essentially a derivative work that has to fit in the confines of the existing world.  I'm sure they can certainly take some liberties, but the pioneering is largely done.  \n\nFor a more explicit example, take Harry Potter.  I'm guessing there's a good chance you've read them.  But in any event, while subsequent works can certainly be enjoyable and fun to read, any author (including Rowling herself) is bound by the original rules of the original series.  Any written work in that universe cannot (figuratively) be allowed to negate or trivialize previous struggles by inventing new stuff.  That is, if some later work introduced a new spell that would have trivialized Harry's struggles in the original 7 books, that's going to be *really* bad writing.\n\nThe same applies to LOK in my mind.  Not that it's written poorly, but now that TLA is canon, the writers have to be careful not to override anything (at least not without significant explanation/retconning).",

The series ends with him being a fully realized Avatar at the age of 12/13 and fully accepting his duties because he found a way to harmonize his beliefs with his duties.  \n\nKorra's character arc is completely different.  She's already done that. She realized she was the Avatar at the age of 4.  She was raised in peace time and security. \n\nAlso, lets look at what being the avatar meant to both Korra and Aang.  For Aang it meant losing all of his friends, losing his teacher, dedicating himself to years more training when he thought he only had to master one element, and fight a looming war with the dangerous fire nation. For Korra, it meant she was instantly elevated to the level of a celebrity. He family (which was already royalty from the Northern Water Tribe) gained even more prestige. She was given the finest teachers, and basically lived in luxury from birth to the beginning of the series.

I still have a personal preference for Korra the Avatar though :)\n\nNo, never really got into Harry Potter, I've only read the first and part of the fifth book and watched the first and fourth movies.",

Unless he is not known to be the Avatar until later on (like aang was).  \n\nAang left because he was upset.  but he was just going out for a ride, I is not as if his intention was to incase himself in ice for a century.  \n\nWhen you are 12, and someone says that you are all of a sudden super important, and you cant be with your friends or your only father figure, that is going to be pretty tramatizing.  It was his intention to leave and cool down.  But even in the first book we see aang regreting his actions.  He did not intend to be gone long, just to cool off.  \n\nHe didnt have the resources until he made them available to himself.  He didnt have any teachers or guidance, and the world was literally against him.  He had to seek out and find earth benders and fire benders to teach him.  not an easy thing to do when the fire nation wants you dead.  \n\nKorra had that support system.  I understand that she didnt have an ideal childhood.  But if you think that being in what was basically a boarding school where you learn to use super powers is the same as being hunted by an entire nation of people, you are very wrong.  \n\nAang and Korra are also very differnt people.  Raised differently and with different mindsets and approaches to life.  I dont think one or the other is better.  I think they have different strengths and weaknesses.  I dont think Korra would have been capable of simply stopping Ozai.  And i dont think she would have been capable of learning from Zuko either.  But, i think she would have been able to learn from aang's first firebending teacher, even without mastery of earth.  \n\nSo, they are different.  But i dont think korra is better.  that isnt to say that she is worse, i just think that they are different. \n\nSome of Korra's character is wrapped around young adult love and \"who is going to take me to prom\" style stuff, but i dont think that is really who she is. so i am not really thinking about that.",

He's seen an astronaut in a movie, maybe, and thinks it looks cool. He has no actual understanding of what an astronaut does, or how rigid and dangerous is. He has no idea that when he turns 12 he's going to discover how much he  actually hates the boring work of astronomy and physics, and that he's not really into working out and prefers writing poetry. By the time he's an adult, being an astronaut is the LAST thing he wants to be.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's not 'genuine' when he said it as a kid. Kids are nothing if not genuine. What it means is that he said it in the way kids say all things: uninformed, mostly emotional, imitating adult behaviors and media depictions with little real understanding. From his perspective, he really does want to be an astronaut, and from an adult perspective, we know that's cute precisely because it's such a child's understanding of the world; that's why we say \"Awww\".\n\nChildhood crushes are the same way. Of course they're absolutely nothing like adult crushes. Of course kids have none of the vital information (like, say, their sexual preferences) that will shape their adult desires. A childhood crush is much more like \"play\", but to kids, play has all the emotional weight of real action. It's incredibly different from an adult crush, but that doesn't make it false or worse, lying to oneself.",

I did the same things--the acting strangely, the telling good friends I had a crush on x, etc etc etc. I also remember obsessing about the crush object and imagining out all sorts of weird narrative scenarios where I have to rescue them or we both realize we're in love through some improbable situation. Strangely at the time it felt a lot like a medieval courtly love, like abelard and heloise--a feeling of intense devotion and obsession, the sense that material signs of love like kissing or dates would \"ruin\" it. So in that sense I agree with you, I think. I even worked up the nerve to tell one girl I liked her in 7th grade, after spending months building up to it, and when I finally did she said \"yeah, I know\" and my mind went blank and I had literally NO IDEA what to do next. Nothing happened and we continued being normal friends. \n\nBut even now (I'm 25 now) and I can get sort of obsessive about certain girls in the same way--just idealizing them and thinking about how great they are all the time and how they complete me. It's a mode of attraction which makes for a lot of unrequited love and, also, makes me act like an ass. This happens ESPECIALLY if I wait a really long time to make a move on someone I like. The way I see it, a crush is like an investment of hope. You dump some imagination into what it would like to be with that person, and then that image feeds you a certain shining. Even though it can slow action, because the reality of what that idealized person actually IS breaks through the illusion which sustains you for so long. ANYWAYS this is all to say while you're right that children don't have any sexual component to their crushes, the fantasy and imagination to evoke romantic feelings can still work. Kids develop those kinds of feelings early on through parental behavior, through culture, etc etc etc. What do you think?",

From the perspective of the characters, Arvo is a known liar, clearly hostile, has tried to escape, and has tried to have your group killed. It just doesn't make sense that so many of the characters go out of their way to help him. \n\nNevertheless, despite all the actions Arvo has taken against the group, they still try to help him. Arvo responds by shooting Clem. Now I think it's important to note that depending on your choices, at the time Clem was shot she would have been completely innocent.\n\nTaking my play through as an example:\n\n* Clem didn't steal from him\n* Clem didn't attack him\n* Clem had put her gun down when she was shot.\n\nArvo shot a little unarmed girl just because he was sad? Doesn't cut it for me.\nFirst off, I don't think we can overlook the fact that Lee was talking to an 8 year old. It seemed very obvious to me that he was sugar coating it a bit.\n\nRegardless, that isn't an excuse, and there are plenty of examples out there that show Arvo was a relatively bad person. \n\nChrista had more of a reason to blame Clem for Omid's death than Arvo had a reason to blame Clem for anything. She didn't take it out on her, or shoot her, she attempted to move and even took care of Clem.\nIt is implied that Lee's crime involved people really close to him, which led to a sense of betrayal and overreaction. It's definitely bad, but not the same as Arvo.\n\nWhat I think you are forgetting is that Arvo was a terrible person BEFORE all the bad stuff happened to him, and that he took out his anger on an innocent bystander.\n\nThe entire catalyst to his shitty situation was him putting Clem's group in mortal danger based on a lie.\n\nI'd even go one step further and say Kenny was right. It seemed really obvious that Arvo was going to try and kill someone. Had the group just been reasonable and listened to Kenny to begin with, then all the deaths in E5 could have been avoided.",

I also financed the rest. \n\nThe surgery was completely painless, but the week after that felt like I had a torn contact. It hurt, yes, but was very uncomfortable. That lasted about two weeks. Several times I had to pull over while driving to work because my eyes hurt so bad, but I'm photosensitive so the surgery isn't solely to blame. \n\nSince then my eyes have felt great. They were very good after surgery, but one eye has slightly diminished. The eye doctor told me that this will be a good thing in the next fifteen or twenty years and will prevent me from needing reading glasses. In the meantime I do not need contacts or glasses. \n\nI cycle and rock climb (and run, swim, weight lift, etc., etc.). Most things I enjoyed were impossible in glasses and as I got older it was harder to wear contacts. If you can afford the surgery I would recommend it.

This meant losing/breaking glasses, spending time in the morning putting contacts in and out, worry about contacts before going to into a pool, etc. The cost of lasik well justifies getting rid of those hassles not to mention that the actual monetary savings. \n\nI remember for the first few weeks after lasik I would be just so thankful to wake up each morning having crystal clear vision. Its now become normal to me but even several years later it will pop into my head and I would think about how awesome lasik is. Cannot recommend it enough.\n\nThe one part of my experience that differed from the commenter above is that I never experienced dry eyes. Actually I differed a little from your post in that I really didn't have any pain either. Maybe lucky? I also paid significantly less than you stated (about half) but that was in part because I was referred to doctor by my sister. If you happen to live in Southern California I recommend the doctor.",

After looking at the conclusions reached by the Warren Commission, I was somewhat skeptical of the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, but the HSCA report clarifies some of the issues surrounding the timing and circumstances of the assassination, and leaves open the idea that Oswald may have had a partner. Additionally, I do feel that the events following the assassination are slightly suspicious (notably LBJ appointing and overseeing the Warren Commission), but are not at present sufficient for me to discount the accepted explanation of the assassination.  The number of conspiracy or alternate theories surrounding the assassination is prodigious and confusing, to say the least, but I am willing to accept an alternate theory and CMV if someone can present a compelling alternate explanation of the JFK assassination supported by clear and provable facts.",
